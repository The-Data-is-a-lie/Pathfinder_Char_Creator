Adorned Strike|Akashic|You have learned to channel the powers of your treasures through the weapons they are adorned to. As a special attack action, you can make a single attack with a weapon produced by the veil adorned with such a treasure and use the standard action ability of the treasure on a successful hit.

If the treasures ability requires a ranged touch attack, it can only be delivered by a ranged weapon attack. The ability is considered to have hit if the weapon attack hits. If the weapon attack is a critical hit, the treasures ability is only considered a critical hit if the initial attack roll was a natural 20 (or a 19 or 20, if you have Improved Critical or a similar ability that doubles the critical threat range of the weapon). If the treasures ability requires a saving throw, the struck creature receives a saving throw against that effect. If the treasures ability normally targets multiple creatures, the struck creature must be included among its targets. If the treasures ability affects an area, the struck creature must be included within its area. The struck creature must be in a legal location within the abilitys normal area (lines and cones still emanate from your space, bursts must be within their maximum range, and so on) otherwise the ability has no effect. If the treasures ability only affects you, such as the teleportation ability of the Keyhole treasure, that ability functions as if you had activated it normally if the attack hits. This ability cannot be combined with other abilities that allow you to apply your supernatural abilities to a weapon attack, such as the conductive weapon special ability. A special attack action represents a unique method of making an aack. They take a standard action to activate, and can be augmented by feats and talents just as if it were any other attack action (such as the Vital Strike feat), but a creature cannot perform more than one special attack action at a time.|ability to adorn akashic treasures|whenever you adorn one of your veils that can produce a weapon (or that can empower your unarmed strikes if you have the adorned fists feat) with a treasure that has a special ability used as a standard action and isnt already delivered with a weapon attack, you can use your weapon to deliver that effect.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Fleshwarped Construct|Akashic|The following akashic upgrades can be selected by a Fleshwarped Construct in additton to the regular akashic upgrades  Adrenaline Surge You gain the ferocity universal monster ability while enveloped by your Akashic Construct.  Extreme Acclimation The Akashic Construct has adapted to some form of extreme environment, granting itself immunity to fire or cold damage. Damage dealt to the Akashic Construct is still split between you and the construct before applying this immunity. You must have a veilweaving level of 9th to select this upgrade, and it may be selected up to two times. Feral Construct When you invest essence in your Akashic Construct, you can choose to grant it two primary claw natural attacks instead of the normal slam natural attack. These claws deal the same dice of damage as the replaced slam attack.  Feral Mobility For each point of essence invested in the Akashic Construct, you gain a 5 foot increase to your base land speed.  Gushing Fluid When damaged the Akashic Construct violently pours forth vitriolic fluid that hoses its attacker. Once per round when the Akashic Construct takes damage from a slashing or piercing weapon, all creatures adjacent to you take 1d6 points of acid damage, plus an addittonal 1d6 points per 2 points of essence invested in the Akashic Construct. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + the essence invested in the akashic construct + your veilweaving modifier) negates this damage.  Improved Feral Construct When you invest essence in your Akashic Construct it gains a primary bite natural attack. The damage dealt by this attack is treated as one size category larger than the slam attack normally dealt by the akashic construct. You must have selected the feral construct upgrade to select this upgrade.  Improved Feral Mobility You gain the pounce universal monster ability. You must have a veilweaving level of 11th and have selected the feral mobility upgrade to select this upgrade.  Instinctive Action If you become unconscious, stunned, or otherwise unable to take actions, your Akashic Construct acts instinctively to best protect you. It has a single standard action on your turn, which it uses to either attack an adjacent creature, move away from danger, or activate an ability of one of your veils. The construct is considered to have an intelligence score of - and a Wisdom score of 10 while acting in this way.  Redundant Organs While enveloped by your Akashic Construct you gain a 25% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage. This upgrade can be taken a second time to increase the chance to 50%, and a third time to grant you immunity to critical hits and precision damage.  Tissue Regeneration You only need to meditate for 1 minute to restore 5 hit points to your Akashic Construct. If your Akashic Construct is reduced to 0 hit points it still requires 1 hour in meditation to restore it to 5 hit points.|knowledge (nature) or knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank, ability to shape an akashic construct|your akashic construct gains the fleshwarp descriptor and all of the associated with that descriptor. your akashic construct can now also be targeted by effects that affect living creatures, aberrations, and constructs. this otherwise functions as normal for effects that target and affect your akashic construct.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
Akashic Constructs|Akashic|Akasha given shape and form to surround its weaver, akashic constructs are a rarely used form of akashic magic. These akashic constructs are difficult to use and require a great deal of specialization to master, but a veilweaver who does so is a formidable foe on any battlefield. Author's Note Despite functioning similarly to a veil, an akashic construct does not count as a veil for the purposes of features that grant you a veil known. Unless you are granted the ability to shape an akashic construct by a class feature you need to take the Shape Akashic Construct feat. Akashic constructs are special veils that function as a combination of creature and magical creation, and are treated as if they had the [Force] and [Enhanced (heavy armor; see text)] descriptors. You can shape this special veil in either the veilweavers Shoulders or Body slots, and it can be invested with essence as if it were a veil. Unlike a normal veil the akashic construct cannot be sundered, though it can still be affected by dispel magic or affected by similar abilities that dispel magic or suppress veils. An akashic construct is still considered a supernatural effect. Being enclosed in your akashic construct counts as wearing heavy armor for any class features, feats, or talents that depend on being armored or unarmored. You gain a bonus to your armor class that is based on your veilweaver level with the akashic construct while enveloped by it (see Table Akashic Construct), and this veil can be enhanced as if it were a suit of heavy armor. Because the akashic construct is derived from force, this bonus to armor class functions against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. The akashic construct is the same shape and size you, with the same number of limbs. It emulates all of your natural attacks, including those granted by veils or other magical effects. While enveloped in your akashic construct, you gain an enhancement bonus to your Strength and Dexterity based on your veilweaver level with the akashic construct, but otherwise use your own ability scores (see Table Akashic Construct). The akashic construct has its own Hit Dice and Hit Points (see Table Akashic Construct). It automatically recovers any hit points it has lost when you rest and shape your veils for the day, but can otherwise be healed as if it were you, or a creature of the construct type. You can also meditate for 1 hour to restore 5 hp to the akashic construct. Whenever you take damage while enveloped by your akashic construct, apply your akashic constructs hardness to it, as well as any other defensive abilities you possess that reduce damage such as resistances, and then split the remaining damage evenly between yourself and the akashic construct (the construct takes the extra damage if it's an odd number). The hardness granted by an akashic construct does not stack with hardness granted by other sources, or with any form of damage reduction. If the akashic construct is reduced to 0 hit points it is immediately dismissed and you cannot envelop yourself with it again until you rest and reshape their veils (restoring it to full health), or meditate for one hour, which returns it to 5 hit points and allows it to be healed as normal thereafter. Essence When the akashic construct is invested with at least 1 point of essence, you gain a primary slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage based on the size of the akashic construct, and the amount of essence invested in it (see Table Akashic Construct Slam Damage) while you are enveloped by your akashic construct. You may also use this slam natural attack in place of your unarmed strikes while enveloped by your construct, though you cant use this slam attack as a natural attack during any round in which you do so. When doing so, it is still treated as an attack made using an unarmed strike for effects that modify unarmed strikes, or for effects that trigger off of unarmed strikes. If you have an effect that increases the base damage dice of your unarmed strikes, it does not apply to the damage of this slam attack when used in place of an unarmed strike (this does not include size increases from other effects). Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Binding the akashic construct to your Shoulders chakra allows you to increase your akashic constructs size. When you envelop yourself in your akashic construct, you can choose for it to be of a size one category greater than your own. For each size category the akashic construct is increased, the space you take up increases by one category and grants you a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a -4 penalty to Stealth checks, and increases your natural reach by 5 feet. You do not gain any other bonuses or penalties associated with your akashic constructs size (such as size bonuses or penalties), but are otherwise treated as the new size for all purposes, such as being affected by combat maneuvers. The akashic construct gains 10 additional hit points and the damage die of its slam increases in size as well (see Table Akashic Construct Slam Damage) for each size category it increases. These bonuses stack with themselves when increasing the akashic constructs size by more than one size category (such as through the effects of the Body bind, or the size increase akashic upgrade). When wielding weapons you are considered to be of the size of your akashic construct, suffering the penalties for wielding undersized weapons if applicable. If one of your veils creates a weapon for you to wield, you can choose for it to produce weapons sized appropriately for your akashic construct. Your natural attacks are also emulated by your akashic construct, dealing damage based on its size when you use them while enveloped by it. Alternatively, rather than increasing your akashic constructs size, you can instead increase the bonus to Dexterity granted by your akashic construct by +2 and grant the akashic construct an additional 10 hit points. These bonuses stack for each size category increase you choose to apply this option to. You must choose this option if increasing your akashic constructs size would make it larger than Colossal. Veilweaving Level Your veilweaving level with the akashic construct determines its statistics. Hit Dice The number of hit dice the akashic construct has. Akashic constructs normally have average hit points per hit die. For a d10, the average is 5.5. multiply 5.5 times the number of hit dice and round down to determine your akashic constructs base hit points. Armor Bonus The armor bonus to armor class granted to you while you are enveloped by the akashic construct. Hardness The akashic construct hardness. This hardness does not stack with hardness gained from other sources, or with damage reduction. Str/Dex Bonus The enhancement bonus granted to your Strength and Dexterity scores while enveloped by the akashic construct. Bonus Hit Points An akashic construct does not have a Constitution score, but begins with 10 bonus hit points at 1st level. Akashic Upgrade At 1st level, and again at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the akashic construct gains a permanent upgrade. By spending 8 hours in meditation, you can exchange a single upgrade you have selected for your akashic construct for another. For every additional 4 hours you meditate, you can change an additional upgrade. For more information on Akashic Upgrades, see below. While enveloped by your akashic construct, you treat the weapons or natural weapons produced by one of your veils, chosen when you shape your akashic construct each day, as if they were one size category larger when determining their damage dice. You may select this upgrade multiple times, allowing you to apply its effects to an additional veil for each selection. The akasha that forms the construct amplifies the weapons you wield, causing them to become more accurate. While enveloped by your akashic construct, you are treated as though you had the Weapon Focus feat with the weapons or natural weapons produced by a single veil, chosen when you shape your akashic construct each day. You may select this upgrade multiple times, allowing you to apply its effects to an additional veil for each selection. While enveloped by your akashic construct, you are treated as though you had the Greater Weapon Focus feat with the weapons or natural weapons produced by one veil selected by the Akashic Targeting upgrade. This upgrade can be taken multiple times, affecting an additional veil each time it is selected. The akashic construct increases its hardness by 5. The akashic construct extends the following construct features to its pilot while they operate it Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns and phantasms). This upgrade can be selected multiple times, selecting a different mech upgrade each time it is selected. Akashic constructs with this upgrade can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather fall. When falling safely, it may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 10 feet it falls. The akashic construct gains a swim speed equal to base land or fly speed chosen when this upgrade is selected. The akashic construct can remain submerged for 1 hour per Hit Die before its air filters start to fail and the pilot has to make Constitution checks to hold their breath or begin drowning.

Symbol of Mercy|Akashic, Combat|This akashic seal is proof that you have the power to slay your foe, and yet chose to spare your blade. Additionally, you may force the creature to enact a single, simple command of two words or less. For example, you may tell a creature to move here or start talking, but you couldnt tell the creature to go to the city (As this would be too many words) or tell the truth as its both too many words and truth is too complex for this ability. Symbol of Mercy is a unique feat that allows one to save an opponent for death. In exchange, they are able to give the target a single command to follow. The GM has the final word on what command can be given, but as a guideline, the command should be simple enough to be stated in one or two sentences. Things like Go home Drop your weapons or Sing the national anthem are all valid choices, assuming that theres nothing preventing the creature from doing so. An immobile creature cannot go anywhere, a wolf cannot drop their weapons (unless they happen to be carrying one), and a bandit couldnt sing an anthem if they had no voice (Or didnt know the words). As commands get more complex, the greater chance they have of not being executed properly, or simply failing out right. A cultist couldnt be forced to tell the truth about a certain incident, after all, as truth is a complicated subject, and while they may be forced to speak about a certain incident, they do not have to tell the truth, or may choose to omit certain details. Likewise, telling someone to complete everything on this page or sign this page, and then presenting someone with a page of tasks or a contract is the same as commanding them to do all of those tasks or adhering to everything in that contract, which would fail because this would be multiple commands instead of the single granted by the feat. Should a command be given that they could not complete, the command is wasted, but the character who owns the feat should have a good idea about what the feat can accomplish and what it cannot; even if the characters player doesnt. Thus, the GM and player should work out what would work and what wont work in regards to this feat.||whenever an opponent within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 character levels) would die or be destroyed, you may intervene as a free action, even if it is not your turn. the opponent is instead reduced to 1 hit point, and an akashic seal is placed somewhere on their body that lasts until next sunrise. while this seal persists, you may prevent the target from taking any action (such as moving, attacking, talking, etc), except the actions that you explicitly allow.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0

Should these images be destroyed by being dispelled or by being struck with an attack, they reform 1 minute later. If you have at least 3 veils shattered, these images become hostile to those who would strike them, dealing your veilweaving modifier in damage when they are destroyed.

Opportunist|Cerulean_Seas|"An opportunist will do anything and everything to fill their stomach. So long as their meal is at another creatures expense in one way or another. The opportunist adds Bluff to their list of class skills. This alters the opportunists class skills. An opportunist learns to shape the magical power known as akasha into powerful veils, which are drawn from the eclipse veil list. They know and can shape any veil from this list. The DC for a saving throw against a veils abilities is 10 + the number of points of essence invested in the veil + the opportunist's Charisma modifier. They can only shape a certain number of veils per day (see opportunist veils and essence table). Veils are constructs of pure magic and are suppressed while in the area of an antimagic field or similar phenomena. At 1st level the opportunist also gains access to their own personal pool of essence, which can be invested into veils and other receptacles to increase their power. The pool of available essence is listed in the opportunist's veils and essence table; the opportunists character level determines the maximum quantity of essence they can invest in any single veil. As a swift action, they can reallocate their essence investments into their veils every round. An opportunist must have a good nights rest and must meditate for one hour to prepare their veils for the day. This ability replaces the hunters orisons and spells class features. Opportunists do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items. The opportunist gains a competence bonus equal to half of their class level (minimum 1) on Bluff checks. This ability replaces wild empathy. The opportunist gains the ability to shape the veil Geri and Freki. When shaping it in this way they treat their effective druid level as -2 (minimum 1) instead of the normal -4. This veil does not count against their normal limits on veils shaped, or their veil slots. As this veil does not count against the opportunist's veil slots or chakras, they can still shape a different veil into the same slot as it freely. Any animal companion granted by this veil counts as an animal companion granted by a hunter's animal companion class feature. If this veil is suppressed, destroyed, or the animal companion it grants are not summoned, the opportunist is treated as having a dead animal companion. This replaces animal companion and one with the wild. Starting at 2nd level when the opportunist uses the ""wolf"" animal aspect on themself it does not count against animal focus's minutes of duration per day, and it remains in effect until the opportunist changes ends it or changes to another aspect. They also gain the ability to invest this animal focus with essence, increasing their range of the scent ability it grants by 10 feet for every point of essence invested. Additionally for each point of essence invested in this focus any animal companion granted to the opportunist by a veil or constellation gains a +1 insight bonus on all Perception and Survival checks based on scent. This ability alters animal focus and replaces the track class feature. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, an opportunist gains the ability to bind veils directly to their chakras, unlocking potent new abilities. The opportunist gains the ability to bind slots in the following order Hands, Feet, Head, Wrists, Shoulders, and Belt. At 8th and 14th level the opportunist increases the maximum essence capacity of all their essence receptacles by 1. At 10th level the opportunist can treat a shaped veil that grants an animal companion as an animal companion's body for the purposes of their raise animal companion ability. Using raise animal companion in this way allows a single animal companion derived from the targeted veil to be summoned immediately, even if it could not normally be summoned due to death or loss of hit points. Such animal companions always suffer 2 permanent negative levels, as if they had been resurrected by raise animal companion normally. These negative level are present each time the animal companion is summoned until either they are removed with a restoration spell or a similar effect, or until the veil that granted the animal companion is reshaped. This ability alters raise animal companion. At 20th level the essence invested in the opportunists Geri and Freki veil is treated as being +1 higher for all mechanical effects. This ability stacks with other virtual essence investment increases such as the magic item akashic catalysts. This ability replaces master hunter."||at 17th level the opportunist gains the of this veil's body bind.|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Elementer|Combat, General|Within the wide spheres of arcane magics, few can match the spectacleand raw powerof elemental magic. Eldritch scholars, hermetic mystics, and pious theurges alike are all likely to tap into the powers of the planes, but none are as focused in their mastery of evoking primal force as the elementer. Whether combining their arcane spells into more potent forms or reducing them to their most basic components, elementers push the powers of air, earth, fire, and water to their limits. These masters of planar magics are not merely bookish magicians, however elementers can draw residual energy into themselves, infusing their very being with roiling elemental might to combat the strongest of foes on equal footing. Role Elementers can compete with enlightened spellcasters and tempered warriors both, but can only direct their power to one of these ends at a time. Careful consideration must be given to how the elementer will engage her foes lest she find herself unable to use her powers at critical moments. Alignment Any Hit Die d8 Starting Age Trained Starting Wealth 4d6  10 gp (average 140 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The elementers class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks per Level 4 + Int Modifier All of the following are class features of the elementer. An elementer is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the glaive, greatsword, handaxe, longbow, short sword, starknife, trident, and warhammer. She is also proficient in light armor and shields (except tower shields). An elementer can cast elementer spells while wearing light armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, an elementer wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass elementer still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. An elementer casts arcane spells drawn from the elementer spell list. An elementer must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the elementer must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an elementers spell is 10 + the spell level + the elementers Intelligence modifier. An elementer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table Elementer. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). An elementer may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the elementer decides which spells to prepare. An elementer must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook except for read magic, which all elementers can prepare from memory. An elementer begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level elementer spells plus three 1st-level elementer spells of her choice. The elementer also selects a number of additional 1st-level elementer spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to her spellbook. At each new elementer level, she gains two new elementer spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new elementer level or depending on what elements she has selected with her fusion class feature, see below) for her spellbook. At any time, an elementer can also add spells found in other spellbooks to her own (see Chapter 9 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). An elementer can learn spells from a wizards or maguss spellbook, just as a wizard or magus can from an elementers spellbook. The spells learned must be on the elementer spell list, as normal. An alchemist can learn formulae from an elementers spellbook, if the spells are also on the alchemist formula list. An elementer cannot learn spells from an alchemist. Many spells on the elementers spell list are categorized under one of four elemental categories air, earth, fire, or water. Spells in these four categories are referred to as elemental spells. Many of the elementers class features, such as fusion and what spells contribute to her energy pool (see below), are dependent on elemental spells. A spell can be listed under more than one category. If a spell is not listed under any of the four categories, that spell cannot be used with class features that require an elemental spell. All elementers learn a potent technique to envelop themselves in elemental force, shaping it into a raiment of energy. This is known as creating an aegis, and while powerful it is not without its limitations. The elementer can enter into her aegis form as a swift action if she has at least one point in her energy pool (see below). Doing so costs 1 point from her energy pool. While in her aegis form, she gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, AC, and CMD, and her weapons count as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every four levels thereafter to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. While in her aegis form, the elementer is unable to cast spells, use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, or gain points in her energy pool. At the start of each of her turns while in aegis form, the elementer loses 1 point from her energy pool. If she ever starts her turn with 0 energy points her aegis form immediately ends. She can also voluntarily exit aegis form as a free action at any time. Once she leaves aegis form (for any reason), she cannot re-enter until the end of her next turn. The full list of affinity powers can be found here. Elementers can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table Elementer under Spells per Day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. As an elementer casts her spells, she retains a portion of their residual power, slowly building it in a reservoir of planar energy. This energy pool has a maximum equal to the elementers level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). She starts each day with a number of points in the pool equal to half its maximum, rounded down. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. The elementer cannot gain points in her energy pool while she is in her aegis form unless explicitly stated otherwise. She can build energy points in one of two ways Beginning at 2nd level, the elementer learns how to twist her spells into a simpler yet effective form. She selects two spell twists from the list at the end of the class description. She gains an additional spell twist for every three levels obtained after 2nd, to a maximum of eight spell twists at 20th level. Each spell twist has an associated elemental category (air, earth, fire, or water). To use a twist, she must sacrifice a prepared elementer spell of the specified elemental category that is 1st level or higher. The exception to this are spell twists with the All category; such spell twists can be used by converting a spell of 1st level or higher from any of the four elemental categories and change their function based on the element used. Using a spell twist is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity unless otherwise stated. If a spell twist calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + the sacrificed spells slot level + the elementers Intelligence modifier. Using a spell twist grants the elementer points in her energy pool as if she had cast the sacrificed spell normally. Unlike spells, the elementer can use spell twists while she is in her aegis form, though she does not gain energy points for doing so, as normal. If she uses a spell twist by sacrificing a spell prepared in a higher-level slot than normal (whether by simply preparing in a higher level slot or by preparing the spell with metamagic feats), she calculates the DC and effects of the spell twist using the level of slot the spell is prepared in, rather than its original level. The full list of spell twists can be found here. Upon reaching 3rd level, an elementer can infuse her arcane spells with further power. Whenever she casts an elemental spell or uses a spell twist that deals damage she deals an additional +1 damage per die rolled. Starting at 4th level, the elementer gains an invisible shield of elemental force that protects her from energy attacks. She gains 10 points of energy resistance in this barrier, which increases by 10 points for every three elementer levels gained thereafter to a maximum of 60 points at 19th level. When the elementer prepares her spells for the day, she must assign these points of resistance to either acid, cold, electricity, or fire, and must do so in increments of 5. For example, a 7th level elementer has 20 points of resistance. She could assign all 20 to fire to have fire resistance 20, have acid resistance 10 and electricity resistance 10, or have resistance 5 for all four types. The elementer has the chosen resistances until she prepares spells again, at which point she can redistribute them as she chooses. to Prepare a Fused Spell Beginning at 6th level, an elementer learns how to combine magical energy into varied and more powerful forms than she would normally be able to create. The elementer must select a single elemental spell category air, earth, fire, or water. When preparing her spells, she may choose to fuse her spell slots to prepare a spell from that elemental category that she has in her spell book. To do so, she must combine a number of spell slots whose total spell levels is greater than or equal to the value shown in Table Fusion for the level of spell she wishes to prepare. For example, if she wishes to prepare lightning bolt (a 3rd level spell), she must give up a number of spell slots whose total levels is at least four or more. This could be any combination of spell slots, such as two 2nd level spell slots or four 1st level slots. An elementer can only fuse a spell of a level that she would normally be able to prepare (2nd level spells when she gains this ability, 3rd level spells at 7th elementer level, and so on). Casting a fused spell counts as casting an elementer spell for all purposes, including applying feats such as Spell Focus or generating points for her energy pool. She cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared this way. When the elementer reaches 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she selects an additional elemental category that she can prepare spells from using fusion. Alternatively, she can select a category she had previously selected to enhance the level of spell she can fuse. If she does, instead of being limited to spells she could normally prepare, she can instead fuse spells from the chosen elemental category whose level is up to half her elementer level, rounded down, to a maximum of 9th level spells when she reaches 18th level. She cannot select the same element more than twice. When the elementer increases in level and gains her two free spells for her spellbook (see Spellbooks, above), she can choose to learn any elemental spell she could prepare with fusion, rather than just spells she could cast normally with her spell slots. Starting at 7th level, an elementer gains the ability to adapt her aegis form to new threats. As a free action, the elementer can exchange her currently selected affinity powers for a new selection. She gains the effects of the new affinity powers while losing the old, including their synergy effects, if applicable. The elementer can do this once per day, plus an additional time per day upon reaching 13th and 19th levels, but only once per round. At 9th level, the elementer can absorb some residual energy from elemental effects. Absorption can be used whenever the elementer is subjected to an effect that would deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to her, but she completely negates the damage in some way (taking 0 damage from the effect). Any method of damage negation, including energy resistance, protection from energy, or the evasion class feature all can trigger this effect. If she reduces the damage to zero, for every 20 points of damage she negated she immediately gains 1 point in her energy pool. This functions even while the elementer is in her aegis form. An elementer cannot trigger absorption from a damaging effect that originates from herself (spell, ability, item, or otherwise). At 15th level, the elementers barrier grows in strength. If the elementer has at least 30 points of resistance assigned to an energy type through her barrier class feature, she gains immunity to that damage type, instead. At 20th level, the elementer becomes a master of the four elements. Half of all acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage she deals ignores any resistances or immunities. This does not bypass her own resistances or immunities. Spells and spell twists she use that deal slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage, such as stone callAPG, ignore any damage reduction that is not DR/ or DR/epic (excluding her own).||at 12th level, the elementers evasion improves. this ability works like evasion, except that while the elementer still takes no damage on a successful reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. a helpless elementer does not gain the of improved evasion.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0

Blind Warrior|Combat|Without sight, youve learned to perceive the environment through heightened senses and dedicated training. Special Upon selecting this feat, you are permanently blinded (if you werent previously blind). If you would somehow regain your sight, you immediately lose this feat, and must retrain it instantly. If a player has chosen to play a blind character via either backstory or taking the Blind Warrior feat, the GM should allow players to stop playing a blind character during the campaign if a player already is or becomes uncomfortable with the concept. Flavour it as magic, a miracle, a result of training, or any other suitable excuse that seems fitting. On the other hand, dont force a cure on the players if they dont want one, whether through in-game actions or out-of-game decrees. If a player is uncomfortable with another persons depiction of a blind character, err on the side of deferring to them and asking the player of the blind character to stop. Blind people are the authorities on how to respect blindness. As a team with disabled members, we encourage you to play blind characters with maturity and to explore the realities of living with blindness. When treated with respect towards blind people, exploring blind characters can be a rewarding learning experience and add gravity to your roleplaying. If you yourself are blind, we hope that we made representing disability positively at the table easier for you.||you gain blindsense 30 feet and blindsight 5 feet as long as you are unable to see. for every three hit dice you possess, your blindsense increases by 5 feet. for every six hit dice you possess, your blindsight increases by 5 feet.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0

Creatures struck by a shard must make a Fortitude saving throw or have their flesh dangerously chilled, halving their movement speeds (minimum 5 feet) and imposing a -5 penalty on Acrobatics checks. Each round at the end of their turn they make a new Fortitude saving throw to end this penalty. These saving throws use The Permafrosts saving throw DC.

Additionally while both veils are shaped, whenever a creature is affected by the standard action ability of either veil you may choose whether you affect them as if they were being affected by your choice of those two veils. For example; if you target four creatures you could choose to treat two as if they were affected by The Gleaming and two as if they were affected by The Gloaming (or any combination of those two veils). When doing so, you use the veil invested with the most essence when determining the effects of both veils. For every 3 points of essence invested in the lesser-invested veil, calculate the healing and damage done by the effect as if the greater-invested veil were invested with one additional point of essence. If both veils are invested with the same amount of essence, choose which counts as the greater-invested veil and which counts as the lesser. If you have the ability to bind veils to your Storm chakra, at the end of your turn you may choose to affect each creature in the area of your veils with either the effects of The Gloaming, the effects of The Gleaming, or both. Your choice applies to each creature in the area.

As a standard action, you can cause a puddle of this rotting rain to form upon terrain in a 10-foot radius burst within your storm. This puddle counts as difficult terrain, persists for 1 round + 1 round per 3 points of essence invested in The Corrosion, and any creature who ends their turn inside the puddle of rot must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effects of the standard-action ability of The Putrefaction. The DC of this saving throw is equal to the saving throw DC of The Putrefaction. Additionally, for every 3 points of essence invested in The Corrosion you may increase the radius of the puddle of rot by 5 feet. If an area of this puddle leaves the storm, that area of the puddle immediately dissipates.|ability to shape two or more storm veils, ability to shape the corrosion and the putrefaction storm veils.|while you have both the corrosion and the putrefaction shaped, their effects combine to form a rain of rotting flesh which quickly erodes all that it touches.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Shaper|General|Beneath the expanses of the multiverse lies an infinite realm of nothingness. A vast gulf of entropy, all planes are connected to and shaped by the null space between realms, a place defined not by its existence but lack thereof. Reaching into this boundary between creation and destruction is usually beyond mortal ability, but it is possible to breach it. Whether born from a desire to mold the world as they see fit, planar experimentation gone awry, or even an otherworldly presence within their soul, a rare few can grasp the darkness between worlds. Called shapers, these warriors manipulate the void to control the battlefield, unleashing planar force that consumes all that would stand in their way. Role A shaper is an arcane warrior that uses reality-bending magic to hinder their foes and protect their allies. They work best in the thick of a fight, unleashing entropic distortions to ravage opponents while warping space to defend themselves. Alignment Any Hit Die d10 Starting Age Trained Starting Wealth 5d6  10 gp (average 175 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The shapers class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks Per Level 4 + Int modifier. All of the following are class features of the shaper. Shapers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields). A shaper can cast shaper spells while wearing armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A multiclass shaper still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. A shaper has power over the void, the null-space between planes that all of existence rests upon. Controlling the quintessence of the void allows her to reshape reality to her whims, molding both arcane energies and disruptive surges of entropy. The shapers quintessence pool has a maximum amount equal to twice her shaper level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), refreshing at the start of each day after gaining 8 hours of rest. Quintessence is primarily used to fuel her void ability, though the shaper can learn new methods of utilizing her quintessence through her distortion feature (see below). A shaper can add half her level to Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (planes), and Spellcraft checks she makes (minimum +1) and can make such checks untrained. All shapers learn to disrupt the planar structure around them, exposing it to the entropic energies of the void to draw in nearby foes and drain their strength. The shaper can spend 1 point of quintessence as a move action to open the void. She must spend 1 point of quintessence at the start of each turn the void is open the void remains in effect until closed as a free action on the shapers turn or if the shaper starts her turn with no quintessence remaining, whichever comes first. The void also closes early if the shaper is knocked unconscious or killed. The void pulls at the space within 10 feet of the shaper; she can make the radius of her void smaller than this, but the radius must be an increment of 5 feet. The area of the void moves with her as she does, affecting any enemies that enter into the area. Enemies within the voids area takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls as the void disrupts space, interfering with attacks. The planar disruption can even consume magic enemies in the area take a -1 penalty on concentration checks and must make a concentration check to cast (DC 10 + the shapers level + her Intelligence modifier) or lose the spell as the void drains the magic of its potency. Treat this as if casting defensively; a foe that is already casting defensively doesnt need to make a second check, but uses either the normal concentration DC or the one for the shapers void, whichever is higher. The penalty to attack rolls and concentration checks increases to -2 at 7th level and to -3 at 15th level. The shaper is immune to the effects of her own void, but not the void of another shaper. The penalties applied from multiple shapers voids do not stack (apply only the highest penalty). Starting at 2nd level, the shaper gains further control over the base quintessence of reality, unlocking new powers and infusing her body with null energies. The shaper gains one distortion of her choice, plus an additional distortion every two levels gained thereafter, to a total of nine distortions at 18th level. The shaper must meet the requirements of a distortion she selects, if any, and cannot select the same distortion more than once. If a distortion calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shapers level + her Intelligence modifier, unless otherwise noted. Certain distortions can modify the effects of the shapers void ability and are marked with an asterisk (*); these distortions do not stack. Only one such distortion can be applied to the void, chosen upon opening the void. A full list of shaper distortions can be found here. Also at 2nd level, the shapers understanding of the fundamentals of reality allows her to perceive magical and supernatural alterations around her. She has the constant effect of detect magic, as the spell, though it does not require concentration and has a range of 30 feet. She can suppress or reactivate this ability as a free action. Starting at 3rd level, the shaper can add her Intelligence modifier (minimum +0) to her touch AC. This cannot cause her touch AC to exceed her normal AC. Beginning at 4th level, a shaper gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from the shaper spell list. A shaper must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a shaper must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a shapers spell is 10 + the spell level + the shapers Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a shaper can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table Shaper. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). When Table Shaper indicates that the shaper gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Intelligence score for that spell level. A shaper may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the shaper decides which spells to prepare. A shaper must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook. Upon reaching 4th level, the shaper gains a spellbook containing three 1st-level shaper spells of her choice. The shaper also selects a number of additional 1st-level shaper spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to her spellbook. At each new shaper level, she gains two new shaper spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new shaper level) for her spellbook. At any time, a shaper can also add spells found in other spellbooks to her own. A shaper can learn spells from a wizards spellbook, just as a wizard can from a shapers spellbook. The spells learned must be on the shaper spell list, as normal. An alchemist can learn formulae from a shapers spellbook, if the spells are also on the alchemist spell list. A shaper cannot learn spells from an alchemist. At 4th level, a shaper can use a hand holding a shield or weapon she is wielding to fulfill the somatic components of shaper spells she casts. She must be proficient with the weapon or shield to do so. At 7th level, the shapers void grows in strength. She may now open the void as a swift action, and the maximum radius of the void increases to 15 feet. Enemies in the area of the void have their movement speeds reduced by half, to a minimum speed of 5 feet. Starting at 9th level, the shapers magics fluctuate with unpredictable entropy, making them more difficult to suppress by traditional means. She adds her Intelligence modifier to the DC to counter, dispel, or remove her shaper spells or spell-like abilities (such as by dispel magic or break enchantment). At 15th level, the shapers void becomes even more potent. The maximum radius of the void increases to 20 feet. Additionally, the pull of the void prevents even extra-dimensional forms of escape, affecting the area of the void as a dimensional lock spell. At 19th level, a shapers void, distortions, and spells are unaffected by antimagic fields, dead magic areas, and similar effects. They can be countered or dispelled, as usual (such as by dispel magic). At 20th level, the shaper has become a master of the void, able to bend reality to her whims. At the start of each day when the shaper regains her quintessence, she may select any combination of two distortions. These distortions can be ones she already knows, but if so they must be distortions that require spending quintessence to use. If she selects a distortion she didnt already know, she gains it as an additional distortion known for the next 24 hours, losing access to it once she regains quintessence the next day (at which point she can choose it again).|at 5th level, and every six levels thereafter, the shaper receives a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. these bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. she must meet the of these feats as normal.|if she selects a distortion she already knows that requires spending quintessence, she reduces the cost by half (rounded down), to a minimum of 0. if this reduces the cost to zero, she can use that distortion at-will so long as she has at least 1 quintessence remaining. this lasts until the shaper regains quintessence the following day, at which point she loses the unless she selects it again with this ability.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
Distortions (Shaper)|General|Starting at 2nd level, the shaper gains further control over the base quintessence of reality, unlocking new powers and infusing her body with null energies. The shaper gains one distortion of her choice, plus an additional distortion every two levels gained thereafter, to a total of nine distortions at 18th level. The shaper must meet the requirements of a distortion she selects, if any, and cannot select the same distortion more than once. If a distortion calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shapers level + her Intelligence modifier, unless otherwise noted. Certain distortions can modify the effects of the shapers void ability and are marked with an asterisk (*); these distortions do not stack. Only one such distortion can be applied to the void, chosen upon opening the void. Adumbral Void* (Su) The shapers void consumes light. While the void is opened, the area of the void has its light level lowered by one step, as a darkness spell. At 10th level, this functions as deeper darkness, instead. The shaper can see through darkness created in this manner. This effect is treated as a 2nd-level darkness effect for the purpose of interacting with light effects, with the effective darkness level increasing by 1 for every four shaper levels gained after 4th. If this distortion is dispelled by a light effect, the shaper cannot use it again for 1 minute. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Anchoring (Su) The shaper can manipulate gravity to anchor herself. She can move along any incline, wall, or ceiling as easily as walking on the ground. The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion. Arcana Drain* (Su) The shapers void drains magical reserves from creatures. Any foe capable of casting spells that enters into or starts its turn within the area of the shapers void must make a Will save or lose a prepared spell or spell slot of 3rd level or lower, similar to the effects of lesser spellcrashACG (though only lasting that single round). For every two levels gained after 10th, the maximum level of spell lost increases by 1, up to 7th level spells at shaper level 18th. The shaper must be at least 10th level before selecting this distortion. Arcane Weakening* (Su) The void drains foes resilience towards magic. Enemies apply the voids penalty to their Will saves in addition to its normal effects. Blink Charge (Su) When making a charge, the shaper can spend 1 quintessence point to bend space around herself, letting her phase through obstacles and strike with immense force. For that charge action, she ignores difficult terrain and can move through the space of other creatures without penalty. If she makes a successful attack or bull rush at the end of the charge, her target takes an additional 1d6 force damage, plus an additional 1d6 force damage for every four levels gained after 4th; this damage can only be applied once per use of this distortion. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Breach (Su) By spending 1 quintessence as a move action, the shaper can open a small rift in space that she can reach through with her hands. The rift appears at a location of her choice within 30 feet of her and lasts a number of rounds equal to her shaper level, though it closes early if she moves from her current location or pulls her hands back out of the rift (a free action). By reaching through the rift, she can perform any action she could logically do with her hands as if she were in that space, such as attacking with a weapon, grabbing objects, or delivering a touch attack. While her hands are in the rift, she threatens the area around the exit point (as if standing in that space), but not the area next to her. Her hands use her normal AC if someone tries to attack her arms while she is reaching through the rift. This is a teleportation effect. The shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion. Breathless (Su) The shaper no longer needs to breathe, allowing her to survive underwater or in airless environments. This negates effects that rely on inhalation (such as inhaled poisons or suffocationUM) or those that rely on scent (such as stinking cloud). The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion. Call of the Void (Sp) The shaper can spend 1 quintessence as a standard action to bend space around a creature within 30 feet. The creature must make a Will save if it fails, it is teleported to the nearest open space adjacent to the shaper. This is a teleportation effect. The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion. Cancel (Su) The shaper can consume magic as its being cast. She must identify the spell being cast as normal. If she successfully does so, the shaper can attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending an amount of quintessence equal to half the level of the spell being cast, rounded up (minimum 1). The shaper must still attempt a dispel check treat this as if using dispel magic to counter the effect. Celerity (Ex) The shaper gains Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. She can use her Intelligence modifier in place of her Dexterity modifier to determine the number of attacks of opportunity she can make each round when using Combat Reflexes. Clinging Shadows (Su) A cloying mass of darkness clouds the vision of the shapers enemies, making them blind to anyone else. When the shaper hits an enemy with a weapon attack, natural attack, or unarmed strike, she can spend 1 quintessence as free action to cloud their vision with a mass of shadows. The target treats all other creatures except for the shaper as if they had concealment (20% miss chance) for a number of rounds equal to the shapers Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). A successful Reflex save reduces the duration to 1 round. The ability to see through supernatural darkness negates this effect, but true seeing does not. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Condense (Ex) The shaper can reflexively manipulate her own mass. She gains a +2 bonus to her CMB and CMD. This bonus increases by +1 at 8th and 16th levels. Consumption* (Su) Vital energy and life force are consumed by the void. Whenever an enemy within the area of the void would be subjected to an effect that recovers hit points (including healing magic, fast healing, or regeneration), the target only receives half of that healing and the shaper receives the other half. If an enemy in the area has a form of regeneration that is stopped by a specific damage type (like fire or acid), that regeneration does not prevent the creature from being slain, so long as it is within the voids area at the time of death. The shaper must be at least 14th level before selecting this distortion. Death Affinity (Ex) Entropy suffuses the shaper with life just as easily as positive energy. The shaper is healed by negative energy instead of harmed by it (as if she were undead), but she only recovers half the usual amount. She is still healed by positive energy as normal. The shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion. Death Field* (Su) A wave of destruction emits from the void with every pulse. Enemies that start their turn within the shapers void or enter into the area of the void on their turn take 1d8 negative energy damage. A Fortitude save halves the damage taken. This negative energy does not heal undead. The damage increases to 2d8 at 7th level and to 4d8 at 15th level. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Decaying Bolt (Sp) The shaper can manifest a ray of decay to harm creatures from afar. As a standard action, the shaper can spend 1 quintessence to fire this ray at a single creature within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). She must make a ranged touch attack to hit. On a successful hit, the shaper deals negative energy damage equal to 1d6 per two levels + her Intelligence modifier. This ray cannot heal undead. Devouring Aegis (Sp) Murky darkness and draining entropy surround the shaper. She can spend 2 quintessence as a swift action to gain the effects of vampiric shadow shieldACG for a number of rounds equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The shaper must be at least 10th level before selecting this distortion. Drift (Su) The shaper manipulates gravity to fall more slowly, as if under the constant effect of a glideAPG spell. At 8th level, the shaper can spend 1 quintessence as a move action to grant herself a fly speed (as the fly spell) for 1 minute. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Essence Harvest (Su) The shapers attacks can drain life from struck opponents. Whenever the shaper scores a critical hit with an attack, she recovers hit points equal to 1d6 times the attacks critical hit multiplier. This cannot restore more hit points than the creature had remaining, nor restore more hit points than the shaper dealt with the attack. The shaper must be at least 12th level before selecting this distortion. Fade (Su) Whenever the shaper would take damage from any source, she can spend 1 quintessence as an immediate action to partially replace herself with intangible shadows, reducing the damage she takes by an amount equal to her shaper level. This only affects hit point damage, not any other effects that accompany the attack (including ability damage or drain). Fold Space (Su) The shaper can spend 1 quintessence point as a move action to teleport a distance up to twice her base movement speed. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Frozen Time (Ex) Time is no longer a hindrance to the shaper. She stops aging and her maximum lifespan is doubled. Age bonuses still accrue, and any penalties already in place remain. She also becomes immune to aging effects and harmful time-based effects like slow or temporal stasis, subject to GM discretion. The shaper must be at least 12th level before selecting this distortion. Genesis (Sp) The shaper learns to make temporary fixtures within the underlying void, letting her create her own extraplanar realms. She can spend 8 quintessence to cast lesser create demiplaneUM as a spell-like ability using its normal casting time. She does not require a focus to do so. Additionally, she may spend 6 quintessence to cast plane shift as a spell-like ability, but only to move willing creatures to and from demiplanes she has created with this distortion. At 16th level, she can spend 12 quintessence points to cast create demiplaneUM, instead. At 20th level, she can spend 16 quintessence points to cast greater create demiplaneUM. The shaper must be at least 12th level before selecting this distortion. Gloom Shield (Su) A barrier of semi-solid darkness forms around a creature to shield it from injury. The shaper can spend 1 quintessence as a standard action to grant a single willing creature within 30 feet temporary hit points equal to twice her level. The temporary hit points do not stack and last for a number of minutes equal to the shapers Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) before dissipating. Grasping Void* (Su) Space distorts around the shaper, pulling creatures ever closer. When an enemy enters into or starts its turn within the area of the shapers void, they must make a bull rush attempt against the shapers CMD. Success allows them to move normally, but failure means they cannot move further away from the shaper that round. Failing by 10 or more also causes the creature to be pulled 5 feet closer to the shaper. The shaper must be at least 12th level before selecting this distortion. Greater Eldritch Sight (Su) The shapers eldritch sight immediately improves, granting her the effects of arcane sight (as the improved eldritch sight ability). When she reaches 13th level, she can use arcane sight to concentrate on a creature as a move action, instead of a standard action. When she reaches 16th level, her eldritch sight improves to act as greater arcane sight with a range of 30 feet. The shaper must have the eldritch sight ability and be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion. Inured to Death (Ex) Closeness to oblivion imparts the shaper with resistance to decay, granting her immunity to death effects and energy drain. The shaper must be at least 10th level before selecting this distortion. Lightweight (Ex) The shaper manipulates gravity to ease her own burdens. Her carrying capacity is tripled. At 8th level, she treats any armor she is wearing as one category lighter when determining her movement speed. Maddening Darkness* (Su) Enemies within the shapers void are exposed to the horrible revelations that exist at the very edges of reality. Any foe that enters into or starts their turn within the shapers void must make a Will save or be confused for 1 round and take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma is driven insane (as an insanity spell). This is a mind-affecting effect. The shaper must be at least 16th level before selecting this distortion. Master of Destruction (Su) A shaper with this ability gains control over one of the most infamous forms of destruction the sphere of annihilation. A shaper with this ability is immune to the effects of a sphere of annihilation (including any gear she is wearing) and gains a +10 bonus on checks to control the sphere. Additionally, the shaper can temporarily manifest an effect similar to the sphere of annihilation; though weaker, it contains much of the same destructive power. Doing so is a full-round action and takes 6 quintessence to use. The sphere briefly appears in a location the shaper can see within 60 feet any creature or object sharing its space takes 10 damage per shaper level. A Fortitude save reduces the damage to 10d6. If reduced to 0 hit points, the object or creature is sucked into the sphere and utterly destroyed. The sphere lasts only until the end of the shapers turn before imploding on itself, after which she cannot use this ability again for 1 hour. The shaper must be at least 16th level before selecting this distortion. Mold Spell (Ex) Reshaping prepared incantations is not so different from reshaping the void. The shaper selects one spell of each level (1st through 4th) from the shaper spell list. The shaper can spontaneously convert her prepared shaper spells into the selected spells, similar to a cleric spontaneously casting cure spells. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Null Sight (Ex) The shaper gains see in darkness, as the universal monster ability, letting her see in magical darkness to any distance. The shaper must be at least 14th level before selecting this distortion. Phase Weapon (Su) The shaper can spend 1 quintessence point as a swift action to shroud a weapon shes wielding with force, allowing it to strike across planes. The weapon gains the ghost touch property and deals an additional 1 point of force damage on a hit. The force damage increases by 1 for every four shaper levels gained after 4th and is multiplied on a critical hit. Both effects last for a number of minutes equal to the shapers Intellgence modifier (minimum 1). The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Planar Maneuver (Su) The shaper warps space to disorient her opponents from a distance. She can spend 1 quintessence as a swift action to activate this effect. For a number of rounds equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), she can perform trip, bull rush, disarm, steal, or reposition maneuvers from up to close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). If she steals from or disarms a foe, she can spend 1 additional quintessence as a free action to cause the stolen item or disarmed weapon to fly to her. If she has a free hand she can catch the taken item; if not, the item lands in her space. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Quicken (Sp) The shaper can spend 2 quintessence points as a swift action to accelerate her own movement, acting as a haste spell but targeting only herself. The effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the shapers Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion. Reality Anchor (Sp) The shaper can force an area back to its natural state. The shaper can spend 4 quintessence to form a reality anchor within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). The anchor has a radius of 15 feet and functions as an antimagic field. The anchor is immobile and lasts for a number of minutes equal to the shapers Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) before ending and can be dismissed as a free action on her turn. The shaper must maintain line of sight to the anchor to keep it in place failure to do so ends the effect immediately. The shaper can only have one reality anchor in effect at a time. The shaper must be at least 14th level before selecting this distortion. Riftstrike* (Su) The void condenses space around the shaper to let her attack foes with ease. While the shapers void is open and it is her turn, her reach increases to cover the same area as the void. This only applies to attacks made during the shapers turn, and does not apply to attacks of opportunity she makes (nor does it increase her threatened area). The shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion. Second Sense (Ex) A shaper with this ability gains a limited ability to peer forward through time to sense threats. Whenever she rolls for initiative, she can roll twice and use either result. Shadowsight (Ex) The shapers vision can pierce through shadows, granting her darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, it is extended by this amount, instead. Shockwave (Su) By spending 2 quintessence points as a full-round action, the shaper can ripple the void nearby to send out a concussive shockwave. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius burst around the shaper takes 1d8 force damage per two shaper levels and is knocked prone. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the prone effect. The shaper must be at least 10th level before selecting this distortion. Spatial Rip (Su) The shaper brings her weapon down, unleashing a blast of disruptive force from its edge. Doing so is a standard action that requires spending 1 point of quintessence. The spatial rip allows the shaper to strike all creatures in 30-foot line with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack she makes a separate attack against each foe in the area. However, the weapons normal damage type is replaced by force damage. Any additional damage to the weapon, such as from the flaming property, deal their normal damage. At 8th and 16th levels, the spatial rip deals an additional 1d8 force damage; this damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. The shaper must be at least 4th level before selecting this distortion. Spell Deflection (Sp) A temporary rift within the fabric of magic allows the shaper to repel harmful spells. The shaper can spend 1 or more quintessence points as an immediate action to reflect a spell back at its caster. This functions as spell turning, but only if the targeted spell is of a level equal to or lower than the number of points expended. If insufficient points are expended, the shaper instead gains an insight bonus on any saving throws allowed by the spell equal to half number of quintessence points spent (minimum +1). The shaper must be at least 16th level before selecting this distortion. Split Time (Su) The shaper can briefly rewind an event, giving her a second chance at success. Whenever the shaper rolls an attack roll or saving throw, she can spend 1 quintessence point as an immediate action to reroll it. She must do so before the result is revealed and must take the second result, even if it is worse. The shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion. Stasis (Sp) A shaper with this power can throw a creature outside of the flow of time. The shaper must spend 4 quintessence and choose a creature or object within 30 feet. The target must make a Will save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to the shapers Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). For the duration, it is undetectable by magic, including divinations it essentially does not exist. Any effects (positive or negative) on the creature do not have their durations progress while the creature is in stasis. At the end of the duration, the creature or object reappears unharmed in the space it last occupied (or the nearest possible space, if the original space is now occupied or hazardous). Once an object or creature has been subjected to stasis, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours. The shaper must be at least 14th level before selecting this distortion. Temporal Reversion (Su) A shaper with this ability can manipulate the passage of time for herself, reverting to an earlier state. The shaper can spend 4 quintessence as a standard action to anchor herself within time. When she does, she records her current location and condition, including current hit points and any ongoing conditions and effects, both beneficial and harmful (including spell effects, poisons or disease, ability damage, fatigue/sicken/other conditions, and so on). As a standard action within the next minute, the shaper can revert herself to this point, restoring her to the same condition and location she was in upon initially using this ability. While this reverts her physically and spatially, it does not restore any used items, charges, spell slots used, quintessence, or other daily resources she might have. Once the shaper reverts herself, the strain put on her body staggers her for 1 round and prevents her from spending any more quintessence (for any reason) for 1 minute. The shaper must be at least 16th level before selecting this distortion. Time Dilation* (Su) The void minutely slows down time within its area, impairing foes ability to evade. Enemies apply the voids penalty to Reflex saves in addition to its other effects. Void Empowerment (Su) The shaper can absorb residual energy from the void the strengthen her attacks. While the shapers void is open, she can spend 1 quintessence as a free action to gain a +1 competence bonus to attack rolls until the start of her next turn. Upon reaching 8th level, the bonus increases to +2. When she reaches 16th level, the bonus increases to +3. Warp Spell (Ex) The shaper can utilize planar quintessence to distort her own spells. Whenever she casts a spell, she can spend quintessence to affect it with her choice of either the Enlarge Spell or Extend Spell metamagic feats without increasing its level or casting time. Doing so requires her to spend quintessence equal to half the spells level, rounded up (minimum 1). She can only apply one effect to a given spell and must follow the usual rules for those metamagic feats. The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this effect. Warp Weapon (Su) As long as the shaper has at least one point in her quintessence pool, she can have any weapon she throws immediately teleport back to her hand after the attack resolves, allowing her to attack with it again in the same turn. She can spend 1 quintessence as a swift action to increase the range increment of her throwing weapons by 20 feet for 1 minute. The shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion. Waste Away* (Su) The void accelerates the passage of time, if only temporarily, causing creatures to age. Any opponent that enters into or starts their turn within the area of the void must make a Fortitude save or be aged to the next age category, similar to a sands of timeUM spell. An undead or construct does not gain a save, and instead takes damage as outlined in sands of timeUM. They must repeat this save each round, the age effect stacking up to old age. At 15th level, the aging effect can stack up to venerable. The aging effect on living creatures ends after 10 minutes. This has no effect on objects, only creatures. The shaper must be at least 8th level before selecting this distortion.|spatial mastery (ex) the shaper becomes more adept at magics that manipulate space. she gains dimensional agilityuc as a bonus feat, even if she doesnt meet the . she becomes immune to teleportation effects unless she allows them to affect her. any teleportation effect she creates (including distortions like fold space) have their range doubled, and any teleportation spells she uses always arrive on-target. the shaper must be at least 10th level before selecting this distortion.|nullify (sp) a shaper with this distortion can strip away magical effects. she can spend 2 quintessence points to cast dispel magic as a spell-like ability. upon reaching 16th level, she can spend 4 quintessence to cast greater dispel magic, instead. this counts as casting dispel magic for the purpose of ing from and qualifying for abilities, feats, or magic items that enhance dispel magic, such as dispel synergyuc. the shaper must be at least 6th level before selecting this distortion.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Vanguard|General|Allies are one of the most valuable assets to have on any battlefield. While most would-be adventurers and gallant heroes must seek out comrades, the few choose instead to make one. Sometimes accidentally, sometimes with intent, a person may find within themselves the spark of creation, animating their constructed companions almost instinctively. These creators, known as vanguards, form a close bond with their companion, their magical essence fueling and empowering the construct. This bond is not one of master and servant, however; vanguards and companions fight as equals, supporting each other and their allies against all odds. Role Vanguards provide both magical power and physical strength, standing alongside their allies in the thick of battle. The magic they cast is best served to support and enhance the strength of the group, using both traditional spell and mystical resonances of power from their companions to achieve victory. Alignment Any Hit Die d8 Starting Age Self-taught Starting Wealth 5d6  10 gp (average 175 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The vanguards class skills are Appraise (Int), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks per Level 4 + Int Modifier All of the following are class features of the vanguard. A vanguard is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. Vanguards are also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A vanguard can cast vanguard spells while wearing light armor or medium armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a vanguard wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass vanguard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. A vanguard casts arcane spells drawn from the vanguard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a vanguard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a vanguards spell is 10 + the spell level + the vanguards Charisma modifier. A vanguard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table Vanguard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). A vanguards selection of spells is extremely limited. A vanguard begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the vanguards choice. At each new vanguard level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table Vanguard Spells Known (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a vanguard knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table Vanguard Spells Known are fixed.). These new spells can be common spells chosen from the vanguard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the vanguard has gained some understanding of through study. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third vanguard level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a vanguard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the vanguard loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spells level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level vanguard spell he can cast. A vanguard may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. A vanguard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not used up his allotment of spells per day for the spells level. Vanguards learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table Vanguard Spells Known under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. A vanguard begins play with the ability to craft a powerful, magically-animated construct companion. A construct companion has the same alignment as the vanguard that creates it and can speak and understand all of his languages. Construct companions are treated as constructs under the vanguards control, though unlike most constructs, the companion is intelligent and capable of independent thought and action. The construct companions general appearance is up to the vanguard, though it is always in the form of a medium humanoid shape. The construct companions Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the vanguards class level and increase as the vanguard gains levels. A vanguard begins play with his construct companion already constructed. The construct companion does not heal naturally. He can spend 8 hours repairing the construct to heal it for 1d6 hit points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 hit points for every two vanguard levels past 1st (max 10d6). If it is ever reduced to 0 hit points, the construct companion breaks and stops functioning (though it isnt completely destroyed). The vanguard must spend 24 hours repairing a broken construct companion to fix it, after which it is restored to its full function and hit points. If the construct companion is ever completely annihilated (such as by a disintegrate spell) or is irretrievably lost, the vanguard can spend 1 week crafting a new construct companion to replace his old one. The new construct companion must have the same augmentation abilities as the old one (see below). A vanguard cannot have more than one construct companion at a time. Rules and statistics for the construct companion can be found here. As a vanguard grows in skill, he gains new ways to improve the abilities of his construct companion. Referred to as augmentations, these abilities allow the vanguard to bind additional magical and physical power to his companion, customizing its capabilities to his liking. At 1st level, the vanguard grants his companion the mending touch augmentation and one other augmentation of his choice, which are found at the end of the class description. At 4th level, and every three vanguard levels thereafter, the vanguard selects another augmentation to apply to his companion. A vanguard cannot select an augmentation more than once, unless otherwise stated. A full list of augmentations can be found here. The vanguards augmentations do not only serve to enhance the strengths of his companion. The vanguard has the ability to create a secondary, more powerful effect by causing a resonance between the constructs augmentations and the vanguards innate magical power. Causing a resonance is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The types of resonance the vanguard can create are based on the augmentations he has bestowed upon his construct companion; each resonance effect is listed under its corresponding augmentation. He may only cause one resonance at a time, regardless of how many resonance effects he can use. If he wishes to use a different resonance, he must dismiss the current resonance (a free action) before creating a new one. The vanguard can create resonances a number of times each day equal to 1/2 his vanguard level + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). At 7th level, creating a resonance can be done as a move action, instead of a standard action. At 13th level, it can be done as a swift action. Resonances rely on the arcane connection between the vanguard and construct companion to function; if the construct companion is shut down or destroyed, the vanguard cannot use any resonances. At 2nd level, a vanguard learns how to imbue his spells onto himself or his construct companion, binding the magic into a piece of equipment, a weapon, or even the constructs body to be triggered later under a specific condition. This functions similarly to using a contingency spell, though the forms of spells that can be used and how they trigger are more flexible. There are two ways a vanguard can imbue a spell A spell can only be imbued if it targets one or more creatures or objects or affects an area. Imbuing a spell takes at least 10 minutes, though it may take longer if the imbued spell has a longer casting time, as described in contingency. A vanguard can only have one spell imbued at a time, and it must be a spell of 2nd level or lower from the vanguard spell list. Imbuing a spell uses up a vanguard spell slot as if the imbued spell had been cast normally. If the imbued spell is not triggered within 24 hours or before the vanguard regains his spells each day, the imbue discharges harmlessly. Starting at 2nd level, a vanguards intuition gives him a bonus on Craft, Disable Device, and Knowledge (engineering) checks equal to 1/2 his vanguard level. He also receives this bonus on Spellcraft checks made to create or identify a magic item. At 5th level, the vanguard gains access to a limited selection of spells to use with his imbue ability. The vanguard can select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard or vanguard spell list and add it to his list of spells known. This must be a spell that he is capable of casting. He may only cast this spell in conjunction with his imbue ability; he may not cast the spell otherwise. At 11th and 17th levels, he learns an additional spell to use with his imbue ability. At 8th level, the vanguard learns how to reconfigure the magical powers bestowed upon his construct companion. By spending 8 hours altering the magic used to animate his companion, he can exchange one of his augmentations for his companion with a different one. The new augmentation must be one he could have qualified for when he gained the exchanged augmentation; for example, if he removes the augmentation he gained at 7th level, he can replace it with any augmentation with a level requirement of 7th level or lower. At 11th level, the vanguard can imbue more powerful magic. The vanguard can now maintain up to two imbued spells at once. One of these imbues can be of a spell up to 4th level, the other can only be of a spell up to 2nd level. The spells can be divided between different weapons, between the vanguard and his companion, or any combination therein. However, a single action or attack can only trigger one imbued spell at a time, even if both imbued spells have the same triggering condition. If multiple imbued spells would trigger simultaneously, the vanguard determines which of the two spells trigger. At 14th level, a vanguard learns how to craft items at a rapid pace. He uses the 1/10 gp value of mundane items to determine how much time it takes to craft them, and he requires only half the normal amount of time to create magical items. In addition, it takes him only 1 hour to repair his companion or to change its abilities with repurpose, 4 hours to restore a construct companion reduced to 0 hit points, or 24 hours to create a replacement for a completely destroyed or lost companion. At 17th level, the vanguards imbue becomes even more powerful. The vanguard can now maintain up to three imbued spells at once. One of these imbues can be of a spell up to 6th level, one can be up to 4th level, and the third can only be of a spell up to 2nd level. The spells can be divided between different weapons, between the vanguard and his companion, or any combination therein. A single action or attack can still only trigger one imbued spell at a time, even if multiple spells have the same triggering condition.|at 3rd level, the vanguards link with his companion allows it to better understand his tactics. the companion automatically qualifies for any teamwork feats the vanguard has, even if it doesnt meet the . it must still learn those teamwork feats, as normal.|at 20th level, a vanguards magical resonance with his construct companion reaches new heights of power. each day when the vanguard regains spells, he can choose a single augmentation his companion has. the vanguard gains the of that augmentation for the entire day. whenever he uses the resonance ability for that augmentation, he and his companion gain the of a battlemind linkuc spell for a number of rounds equal to the vanguards charisma modifier (minimum 1).|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Detect Hostility|General|You know how to search for the killing intent that creatures subconsciously aim at their enemies. At any time as a standard action, you can attempt a Knowledge (martial) check to detect whether any creatures within 30 feet carry a desire to fight, kill or otherwise defeat someone they can see. Using this ability does not require you to be aware of the creatures in question, but you cannot sense hostility from a creature immune to mind-affecting effects unless they are actively focusing it onto another creature in some way (such as via the Intimidate skill, the paladin's smite evil, the cavalier's challenge or the harbinger's dark claim). If you succeed then you learn the locations of each source of hostility, as well as the type of hostility involved (friendly, adversarial or malicious). If you succeed by 5 or more then you can determine who these hostile feelings are directed at, as long as both the target and the aggressor are within your line of sight. You always know if hostility is directed at you, even if you cannot see the target. If an aggressor is concerned of its hostility being noticed and wants to hide it, then the Knowledge (martial) DC is instead equal to 10 + their Bluff modifier (if higher than the normal DC). Creatures using the Stealth skill are assumed to be hiding their hostility unless stated otherwise. Special Outsiders with the evil subtype are considered to radiate malicious hostility towards all creatures they can see, regardless of the personality and goals of the outsider in question. At your GM's option, other kinds of creatures might radiate hostility of different kinds (such as celestials radiating friendly hostility, or ghosts radiating adversarial hostility). A warder with the sworn protector archetype (or a character with a similar ability) may treat hostility aimed at their ward as hostility aimed at themselves for determining their ability to sense it.|blind-fight feat or the scent ability, knowledge (martial) 5 ranks.|you can perform the anticipate ambush occult skill unlock even if you can't cast psychic spells. if you can cast psychic spells or have the psychic sensitivity feat, you can use anticipate ambush one additional time per day.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Warden|General|Be it a virulent plague, encroaching civilization, or a natural disaster, the harmony of the wilds is constantly under threat. The natural world will often reach out for aid wizened hermits, agile hunters, and enigmatic shamans alike have all answered the call throughout the ages. Yet among them, few are as steadfast in their role as the warden. Both stalwart champion and contemplative sage, a warden is a devoted guardian of the land and its inhabitants. They immerse themselves in nature, acting as protectors of the wild and receiving protection in turn. Wardens hear the whispering lore among the trees to unlock veiled secrets of life and regrowth, and when threatened channel the facets of the wilds itself, blessing their allies and shielding them outsiders. Role Wardens are protectors, standing in the way of those that would harm nature. Their powerful wards serve as the cornerstone of defense for their allies, while the magics they harness give them the means to heal, navigate, and master their environment. Alignment Any Hit Die d10 Starting Age Trained Starting Wealth 5d6  10 gp (average 175 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The wardens class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). Skill Ranks Per Level 4 + Int modifier. All of the following are class features of the warden. Wardens are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A wardens awareness of his surroundings allows him to defend himself with focused perception rather than reflex. The warden may add his Wisdom modifier, instead of his Dexterity modifier, to his Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause him to lose his Dexterity modifier to his AC instead causes him to lose his Wisdom modifier to his AC, and he cannot gain this bonus while wearing heavy armor. Additionally, his armors Maximum Dexterity Bonus still applies (limiting how much of his Wisdom modifier can be added to his AC), and the bonus he receives to his AC from his Wisdom score cannot exceed his warden level (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 2nd level, and so on). At 1st level, a warden gains a bonus on all Handle Animal, Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), and Survival checks equal to 1/2 his warden level (minimum 1) and can make such checks untrained. A wardens connection to the natural world is represented by his verdant bonus. A wardens verdant bonus begins at +1 and increases by 1 at 4th level and every four warden levels obtained thereafter, as shown on Table Warden under Verdant Bonus. As long as he is not wearing heavy armor, the warden receives a bonus to his AC and CMD equal to his verdant bonus. The wardens verdant bonus is also used to determine the strength of his ward, as well as the effects of many of his facets (see below). A wardens most powerful tool is his ward, a mystical barrier of natural energy that protects those within and grants them the strength of the wilds. Creating a ward is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The ward is a spherical emanation with a maximum radius of 10 feet; the warden can choose to manifest a ward with a radius of any multiple of 5 feet up to this maximum. The ward itself is faintly visible as a translucent barrier the ward does not hinder sight in any way (or block line of sight or effect), nor does it produce light. The ward must be placed at a location within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) that the warden can see and has line of effect to. The ward is stationary, and can only be moved by manifesting it again in a different location. All allies inside the ward (including the warden) are protected from extreme temperatures, as if under the effects of an endure elements spell. Allies within the ward are also shielded from harm, gaining an insight bonus to their AC equal to the wardens verdant bonus. The warden does not receive this bonus to his own AC, even from another warden, as he already has it inherently from the verdant bonus feature. A manifested ward lasts indefinitely so long as the warden remains within close range of the ward (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); if he moves outside of this range or if he is slain, the ward dissipates immediately. He can also dismiss an active ward as a swift action. There is no limit to the number of times each day a warden can manifest a ward, but he may only have one ward placed at a time. If he manifests a new ward, the previous one immediately dissipates. A warden can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 1/2 his warden level + his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Remedy has no effect on undead or constructs. A wardens devotion to nature is rewarded with knowledge of its hidden mysteries. When he reaches 2nd level and every three warden levels thereafter, he gains a single secret from the list below. A secret cannot be selected more than once. If a secret calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wardens level + his Wisdom modifier unless otherwise noted. A full list of secrets can be found here. Beginning at 3rd level, the warden learns to call upon and embody the varied aspects of natural environments. Referred to as facets, each of these enigmatic forces act as the wardens sword and shield, granting him the means to protect allies and strike at those that would oppose them. Once per day, the warden may select a number of facets to prepare as shown on Table Warden under Facets Prepared. The full list of facets is located at the end of the class description. These facets remain prepared indefinitely until the warden chooses to prepare again. Each facet comes in three levels lesser, greater, and grand. At first, the warden may only prepare lesser facets. Upon reaching 9th level, he may prepare greater facets, and upon reaching 15th level he may prepare grand facets. However, facets must be prepared in ascending order of strength. In order to prepare a facet, the warden must have prepared all versions of that facet of a lower level. For example, if the warden wants to prepare the River of Life grand facet, he must also prepare both the lesser and greater versions of River of Life. Each of these prepared facets counts separately (in the previous example, preparing the lesser, greater, and grand versions of River of Life counts as three of the wardens prepared facets for the day). A full list of facets can be found here. At 3rd level, the warden becomes immune to diseases, including both magical and supernatural diseases. Starting at 4th level, a warden taps into his instinctual awareness of threats. The warden adds his Wisdom modifier to initiative checks in addition to his Dexterity modifier. He can always act in the surprise round even if he fails to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but he is still considered flat-footed until he takes an action. At 7th level, a warden becomes immune to poisons of any kind. At 9th level, the wardens ability to manifest wards improves. He can now manifest two separate wards, each with a maximum radius of 15 feet, which can be maintained so long as he remains within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). Each one must be manifested with a separate swift action. If he tries to manifest more than two wards, he chooses which of the current wards dissipates. He can apply a different facet to each ward he places. The areas of his wards are unable to overlap if he attempts to place a ward to overlap a ward he already has placed, the older ward dissipates immediately. The warden can also determine how healthy creatures within his wards are, as a status spell. This effect only applies to willing creatures, and the effect is removed if a creature leaves the area of the ward. Starting at 13th level, the warden gains the ability to step across leylines to swiftly help those within his ward. As a move action, the warden can teleport a distance up to twice his normal movement speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The ending location of this teleportation must be an open location within the area of a ward he or another allied warden has manifested. At 15th level, the warden gains further strength for his wards. He can now manifest three separate wards, each with a maximum radius of 20 feet, which can be maintained so long as he remains within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level). As with improved ward, he can apply a separate facet to each ward he places and the wards cannot overlap. Upon reaching 16th level, the creatures of the wild come to respect the wardens presence. Creatures of the animal, plant, or vermin type of Intelligence 2 or less never attack the warden or any of his allies within 20 feet of him unless magically compelled to do so. Creatures of these types with Intelligence 3 or higher can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wardens level + his Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect for 24 hours. If the warden or his allies take any hostile action towards the creature or its allies, it becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours (even if they failed their saving throw earlier). Starting at 19th level, a warden gains a near-prescient sense of possible threats. The warden treats his initiative roll as always being a natural 20 and he is never surprised. At 20th level, the warden ascends, joining the guardian voices of nature to become one of its everlasting protectors. His type changes to outsider, and he can count as either an outsider or his original type for the purpose of spells and effects (whichever is more beneficial to him). Additionally, the warden stops aging. Age bonuses still accrue, but he does not take any penalties for his age, any age penalties he previously had are removed, and he does not die from old age. Even if he dies from some other cause, he will spontaneously come back to life (as a resurrection spell) 24 hours later at a point of his choosing within 20 miles of the place he died. He must have visited the place he returns to life at least once.|at 2nd level, and every four levels thereafter, the warden receives a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. these bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. he must meet the of these feats as normal.|at 12th level, a warden can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. if he makes a fortitude or will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. this ability can only be used if the warden is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. a helpless warden does not gain the of the stalwart ability.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Nightblade Arts|General|As a nightblade gains experience, she learns a number of techniques and powers that enhance her combat skill and shadow magic. Starting at 3rd level, a nightblade gains one nightblade art. She gains an additional nightblade art for every three levels of nightblade attained after 3rd level. A nightblade cannot select a particular art more than once. If a nightblade art calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the nightblades level + her Charisma modifier. A nightblade can choose from any of the following nightblade arts or from any of the arts listed for her chosen path. Beckoning Shadows (Su) As a standard action, the nightblade can target a single creature within 60 feet and teleport it to another location within 60 feet she can see, following the same limitations as her shadow shift ability. The destination must be on solid ground and cannot be a location that is by nature hazardous to the creature the nightblade is teleporting. A Will save negates the effect. The distance the nightblade teleports a creature with this art counts double against her total daily distance she can teleport with her shadow shift ability (which is spent even if the creature makes its save). The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art. Casting Art (Ex) The nightblade gains a metamagic feat as a bonus feat. When she casts a darkness, shadow, or shadowmorph spell that is affected by one or more metamagic feats that would raise its level, she reduces the total level adjustment to that spell by 1. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art. Cloak and Dagger (Ex) When attacking a creature she is flanking or that is denied their Dexterity bonus to AC, the nightblade gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 at 9th and 15th levels. Combat Art (Ex) The nightblade gains a combat feat as a bonus feat. She may use her nightblade level in place of her base attack bonus to qualify for the feat. Condensed Shadows (Su) When the nightblade spends a standard action to recover her shadow surges, she gains concealment until the end of her next turn. At 9th level, if she uses a full-round action to recover multiple shadow surges, she instead gains total concealment until the end of her next turn. Both forms of concealment do not prevent enemies from targeting her, nor do they allow her to make Stealth checks to hide. Dark Reality (Ex) A nightblade with this art can use real darkness to improve the potency of shadowstuff. When casting a shadow spell that replicates one or more spells from a school of magic (such as shadow conjuration), creatures within dim light, darkness, or magical darkness take a -4 penalty to their Will save to disbelieve the effect. This penalty only applies to the initial save to disbelieve, not any other saving throws the replicated spell might have. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art. Dark Resurgence (Su) The nightblade can quickly recover her shadow powers. Once per day as a free action (even when its not her turn), the nightblade can gain all of her shadow surges back, up to her maximum amount. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art. Deaden Senses (Ex) A nightblade with this art is able to hide even from those with extraordinary senses. She can use Stealth to hide from creatures with blindsense or blindsight as if they didnt have that ability. At 15th level, she can also hide from creatures with tremorsense. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art. Disguising Veil (Sp) The nightblade can spend 1 shadow surge to veil her appearance, as disguise self, using her nightblade level as her caster level for the effect. Dusk Strike (Su) By expending a shadow surge as a swift action, the nightblades melee, ranged, or natural weapon shifts partially into the Plane of Shadow, bypassing a targets defenses. The next weapon or natural attack the nightblade makes resolves against touch AC, rather than the targets normal AC. If the nightblade doesnt make the attack before the start of her next turn, the effect is wasted. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art. Fall of Night (Su) The nightblade can spend a shadow surge as an immediate action when she confirms a critical hit to flood her target with shadowy energy. The nightblade can choose to either blind, stagger, or exhaust her target. The chosen effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the weapons critical multiplier, with a Fortitude save reducing the effect to only 1 round. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art. Focused Cast (Su) The nightblade can expend a shadow surge as a free action to take 10 on a concentration check, even if circumstances would normally prevent her from taking 10 on a check. Ghostwalker (Su) By use of shadowstuff, the nightblade can temporarily phase through matter as if she was only partially real. She can spend 1 shadow surge as a swift action to turn quasi-real until the end of her turn. While in this state, she can move through the space of creatures without penalty. She also move through objects, walls, or other surfaces that are up to 5 feet thick per nightblade level. In either case, she cannot end her turn inside of a creature or object. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art. Hidden Stride (Ex) The nightblade can move at full speed while using the Stealth skill without penalty. When in dim light, the miss chance due to concealment against the nightblade increases to 50% (rather than 20%); this does not grant total concealment, it just increases the miss chance. Mystic Shade (Su) The nightblade can use her shadow magic to emulate the abilities needed to activate wands, scrolls, and the like. She can expend a shadow surge as a free action when making a Use Magic Device check to roll twice on the check and take the better result. Penumbral Aegis (Ex) The nightblade can use shadowstuff to redirect attacks that would bypass her defenses. She adds her Charisma modifier (minimum +0) as a bonus to her touch AC. This cannot make her touch AC exceed her normal AC. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art. Shadow Cache (Sp) The nightblade can carve out a space in the Plane of Shadow to hide her belongings, acting as the spell secret chest using the nightblades level as her caster level. Unlike secret chest, the chest is made of shadowstuff (meaning it does not cost anything) and lasts until the nightblade either dismisses the cache or is killed. Creating, hiding, and summoning the chest can be done at-will without a focus as a full-round action. Creatures cannot stay in the cache and are left behind when the chest is sent back to the Plane of Shadow. The nightblade can only maintain one shadow cache. If she dismisses the cache or is killed while it is on the Plane of Shadow, the items in the chest remain there and cannot be recalled by any means, even by creating another shadow cache. A planar expedition to the Plane of Shadow can be made to find the chest. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art. Shadow Form (Sp) The nightblade can turn herself into a natural shadow, as the spell tenebrous form, for a number of minutes per day equal to her nightblade level. This duration does not have to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art. Shadow Motion (Su) The nightblade can spend a shadow surge as a swift action to bend the space she is in by partially moving into the Plane of Shadow. Until the end of her turn, she gains a 30-foot increase to her speed and can roll twice on any Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim checks she makes and take the better result. Shadow Run (Su) While in darkness, the nightblades legs become shadowy wisps that bend and flow around the terrain. As long as she is in dim light, darkness, or supernatural darkness, she ignores difficult terrain. Other penalties associated with moving over the terrain (such as damage) still apply. At 9th level while in dim light, darkness, or supernatural darkness, she adds her Charisma modifier to her CMD against attempts to trip, bull rush, reposition, or otherwise move her from her current space (minimum +0). Shadow Transference (Su) The nightblade can manipulate shadow magic effects after they have been created, even those created by others. By expending a shadow surge as a swift action, she can adjust the location or target of an ongoing spell with the darkness, shadow, or shadowmorph descriptor or of the shadow subschool. She can shift the spell to another valid target (if it is targeting a creature or object) or location (if it is targeting a specific point or area) within 30 feet of the original target/location. If the spell was cast by another creature, the original caster can make an opposed caster level check to prevent her from transferring the spell. The shadow surge is still spent, whether the transference was successful or not. Spell Resistance and saving throws apply to the new target of the spell (if applicable). The spell uses its original DC and caster level (regardless of its source), but caster level checks to overcome Spell Resistance always use the nightblades caster level. She cannot use shadow transference on a spell with a range of personal. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art. Shifting Focus (Su) The nightblade can teleport an extra 100 feet each day using her shadow shift ability. The nightblade can also take other willing creatures that are adjacent to her with her when she shadow shifts. She must spend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought along. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art. Warp Strike (Su) By spending a shadow surge as a swift action, the nightblade can shift into the Plane of Shadows, distorting the distance between herself and her target. Until the end of her turn, all of her melee weapon attacks, natural attacks, and unarmed strikes have their reach increased by 5 feet. At 9th level and 15th level, her reach increases by an additional 5 feet. She may also perform this with a single melee touch attack made on her turn. Alternatively, she can reduce the penalty on ranged weapon attack rolls due to distance by 2 until the end of her turn. At 9th level and 15th level, the penalty is reduced by an additional 2.|ebon craft (ex) the nightblade gains an item creation feat of her choice as a bonus feat. she must meet the of this feat as normal. whenever she crafts a magic item (except a potion, spell-trigger item, or spell-completion item) she may utilize shadow magic to replicate some of the required spells, letting her ignore one spell without increasing the creation dc. she can ignore an additional spell at 15th level. the nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art.|void sight (sp) the nightblade can grant others the ability to see in even the darkest of shadows. as a standard action, the nightblade can grant willing creatures within 30 feet the of both an eyes of the voidacg spell and a see invisibility spell, using the nightblades level as her caster level for each effect. the nightblade can affect one willing creature per three nightblade levels she has, to a maximum of 6 creatures. the nightblade can use this ability once per day. the nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Invoker|General|Whether by an innate affinity for wild magic, a mystical gift by some greater force, or by having a powerful strength of will, invokers find the spirits of the natural world drawn to them. In time, they invariably form a covenant with one of these spirits, one who resonates with the invokers soul and ideals. The two form an inseparable pair whose very essence is intertwined, becoming greater than the sum of their individual strengths so that they may protect themselves and that which they hold dear. As they grow in mutual understanding and power, they draw further spirits to their cause, channeling the strength of the countless voices of the wilds to take on any threat. Role Invokers are as diverse as the spirits they bond with, but they generally serve as mystical warriors while their spirit companions provide aid from afar. Their ability to bond to different spirits allows them to adapt as needed to face down any challenges that would threaten their homes. Alignment Any Hit Die d10 Starting Age Self-taught Starting Wealth 4d6  10 gp (average 140 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The invokers class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). Skill Points Per Level 4 + Int modifier. All of the following are class features of the invoker. Invokers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Out of the multitude of spirits that the invoker contacts, he will eventually find a particularly strong spirit with whom he will form a lifelong bond. The invoker begins play with this spirit companion already by his side. Spirit companions come in innumerable forms, but are grouped together by the two aspects of their nature their dominion, and their oath. The dominion represents what realm of nature the spirit hails from, such as Beasts or the Sky. The oath describes the spirits relationship with its dominion for example, a Guardian devotes itself to the protection of the dominion, whereas a Harbinger brings forth its wrath upon foes. The dominion and oath of the invokers spirit companion must be chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed. The abilities granted to the companion from its dominion and oath are listed in their respective sections (which are linked below). The spirit companion has the same alignment as the invoker and can speak and understand all of his languages. No two spirit companions are identical in appearance and are clearly mystical in origin, possessing traits that are indicative of their dominions and oaths. Most are humanoid or animalistic in shape, though more exotic forms are known. The form of a spirit companion has no impact on its abilities or statistics. A spirit companions Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the invokers class level and increase as the invoker gains levels. If a spirit companion is ever slain, the invoker may spend 24 uninterrupted hours of meditation while in an environment relevant to the spirits dominion (for example, near a river or body of water for a Sea spirit) to draw forth the power of his dead companion and reform it, bringing the spirit companion back to life with full hit points. Rules and statistics for the spirit companion can be found here. A list of dominions can be found here. A list of oaths can be found here. The invoker spell list (which spirit companions can cast spells from) can be found here. At 1st level, an invoker is able to contact minor spirits from the wilds. While not as strong as his companion, these spirits each bestow new powers upon the invoker and his companion to aid them in their cause. The invoker selects two lesser spirits to bond with at 1st level and gains an additional lesser spirit at 3rd level and every three levels thereafter to a total of eight lesser spirits at 18th level. Like the invokers companion, each of these lesser spirits has a dominion and oath describing its nature. While he can select leser spirits from any dominion or oath, one of the lesser spirits gained at 1st level must exactly match the dominion and oath of his companion. For example, if the invokers companion is an Acolyte of Beasts, the invoker must select Predator Silently Hunts its Prey as one of his starting lesser spirits. Each lesser spirit taken has a listed primal power, which is a special ability granted to the invoker for bonding with it. The invoker knows the primal powers of all lesser spirits he has bonded with. Using a primal power requires the invoker to spend one or more points of primal energy (see below); if he lacks the required primal energy, he cannot use that primal power. Primal powers are spell-like or supernatural abilities and require a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. If a primal power calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invokers level + his Charisma modifier. Additionally, each lesser spirit has a list of spells of 1st through 4th level. When an invoker bonds with a lesser spirit, he immediately adds all of its spells to the invoker spell list, if they werent already on it. His spirit companion does not automatically gain them as spells known and must learn them as normal. Other abilities granted by lesser spiritsnamely, invocation powersare only granted once it has been invoked (see below). A list of all lesser spirits can be found here. At 1st level, the invoker gains a pool of natural energy that he uses to channel the powers of his lesser spirits. This pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 the invokers level + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and refills at the start of the day after 8 hours of rest. The invoker can spend points from the primal energy pool to use the primal powers of any lesser spirit he has bound to him, plus a select few other class features. If he does not have the required number of primal energy points to activate a given primal power or class feature, it cannot be used. At 2nd level, the invoker learns his signature ability the power to invoke spirits. By doing so, the invoker can channel even greater power from those spirits to gain primal strength, debilitating magics, or supernatural resilience. At the beginning of the day when the invoker regains his primal energy, he may choose to invoke a spirit he has bonded to. Doing so takes 1 hour, and he may only invoke a spirit if that spirits dominion or oath (or both) match the dominion and/or oath of his spirit companion. For example, if the spirit companion is a Harbinger of the Sky, the invoker could invoke any Harbinger spirit or any Sky spirit. An invoked spirit remains so until the invoker chooses to invoke again, and he may only have one spirit invoked at a time. So long as that spirit is invoked, the invoker gains that spirits minor invocation ability. As the invoker increases in level, he progressively gains stronger invocation abilities, as shown on Table Invoker as follows minor (2nd), intermediate (5th), greater (11th), and grand (17th). The DC of any saving throws called for in an invocation ability is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invokers level + his Charisma modifier. At 4th level, the bond between invoker and spirit companion extends to their physical being. Whenever his companion takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 hit points or lower, as a reaction to the damage, the invoker can sacrifice any number of his hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the companion. In addition, the spirit companion can cast supportive magic on the invoker from a distance. The spirit companion can cast any spell with a range of personal or touch, or a spell with a target of You, upon the invoker from a range of close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Doing so requires the companion to spend a full-round action to cast the spell; if the casting time is already longer than a full-round action, use the spells normal casting time, instead. The spell must be able to target a creature and be appropriate for the invokers type. Starting at 5th level, the invoker learns the power to invoke two lesser spirits at once. This follows the same restrictions as his first invocation, but the levels he gains the secondary spirits invocations are delayed, listed on Table Invoker as follows minor (5th), intermediate (8th), greater (14th), and grand (20th). The invoker has to invoke two separate lesser spirits, and must designate which of the two lesser spirits is the primary spirit and which is the secondary (and thus determining when he gets that spirits invocation abilities) at the time of him invoking, and cannot change the chosen order until he invokes again. Beginning at 6th level, the invoker is able to invoke multiple times throughout the day. Doing so requires spending 1 point of primal energy for each lesser spirit he is invoking and takes 1 hour of uninterrupted concentration the first invocation he performs at the start of the day does not require spending primal energy, as normal. If he is interrupted, the primal energy is wasted and he must try again. At the end of the hour, the invoker can exchange the selected lesser spirit with a different one of his lesser spirits following the normal guidelines, gaining the newly-invoked lesser spirits abilities while losing the old ones. At 7th level, the invoker and his spirit companion can merge their forms together, achieving strength greater than the two could alone. As a full-round action, the invoker can touch his spirit companion and draw it into himself; this also merges the spirit companions gear (if any), similar to a polymorph effect. While merged, the spirit companion cannot be targeted or harmed, and any effects and spells upon the spirit companion are suspended until the companion separates from the invoker. For the duration of the avatar, the spirit companion can cast spells through the invoker using the invokers actions, though it still uses its own statistics to do so (such as spell save DCs or concentration checks). As a free action once per round on the invokers turn, the invoker can sacrifice any number of the companions spell slots. Upon doing so, he regains points in his primal energy pool equal to half the total level of spells sacrificed, rounded up. Any points in excess of the invokers primal energy maximum are lost. The invoker and spirit companion can communicate mentally with each other while merged, and the spirit companion can use the invokers senses to help guide him. When the invoker speaks, his voice is both his own and that of his companion speaking in unison. While the above effects are shared among all invokers, the true potential of the avatar ability is based upon the spirit companions dominion and oath. Both the oath and dominion of the companion grant additional effects to the avatar form, as listed in their entries. The invoker also takes on traits that signify the dominion and oath, such as fiery hair, grass and flowers growing around his every step, flesh that looks like quartz, or some other exotic, magical effect related to his spirit companion. These traits manifest differently for each invoker, but are always harmless and have little gameplay effect. Avatar lasts for a number of minutes equal to the invokers Charisma modifier (minimum 1), until the invoker ends it early (a swift action), or until the invoker is slain, whichever happens first, at which point the spirit companion emerges in the nearest open space. If the invoker is killed, his spirit companion is ejected at 0 hit points and staggered. The invoker can use his avatar once per day, plus an additional time per day at 13th and 19th levels. At 10th level, an invoker can use his spiritual energy to bring a slain spirit companion back to life. This functions as raise dead, but it may only be used to target his spirit companion or the companion of another invoker. Using this power takes 10 minutes, removes all remaining points from his primal energy pool, and can only be done once per week. At 16th level, this ability functions as resurrection instead, but otherwise acts as described above. Beginning at 12th level, the invoker can commune with lesser spirits more rapidly. It now only takes him 10 minutes to invoke, whether that be his free invocation at the start of the day or an additional invocation performed through the spiritual emissary class feature. The invoker can spend 2 primal energy points to replace one of his invoked lesser spirits with a different spirit as a swift action. He can also use this to swap which of his two invoked lesser spirits is the primary spirit and which is the secondary. He may do this any number of times per day, but no more than once per minute. At 16th level, the invoker and his spirit companion may communicate telepathically as long as they remain within range of the spirit companions link (see the spirit companion rules after the class description). At 20th level, the invoker is accepted among the spirits of the wild and can call upon them as needed. The invoker can use the primal power of any lesser spirit, not just the ones he has selected. Using a power for a lesser spirit he does not already have costs twice the amount of primal energy required. Additionally, when the invoker uses quickened invocation to replace his lesser spirits, he can replace both of them with the same action. It costs him 1 primal energy per lesser spirit he replaces, rather than 2. He can use quickened invocation as frequently as he wants without needing to wait for one minute between uses.|at 3rd level, and every six levels thereafter, the invoker receives a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. these bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. he must meet the of these feats as normal.||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Cabalist|General|There is a power that lurks just beyond the boundary of humanity. Enigmatic and unknowable, the extent of their domain is as unfathomable as their motives. Few are aware of their existence, and among those that know, many rightfully view these mysterious entities with cautionor fear. However, there are those that would choose to entreat the overwhelming powers that lurk between the stars. Whether out of desperation, a pervasive madness, or simply the desire for knowledge, these cabalists make contact with eldritch forces to control them. Masters of occult rites, cabalists bind aspects of otherworldly beings to themselves, warping their body and mind to grow beyond the limits of humanity. Alignment Any Hit Die d8 Starting Age Trained Starting Wealth 4d6  10 gp (average 140 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The cabalists class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks per Level 4 + Int Modifier All of the following are class features of the cabalist. Cabalists are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the greatsword, light flail, ranseur, rapier, sap, scythe, short sword, and warhammer. They are proficient with light armor and medium armor, but not with shields. A cabalist casts psychic spells drawn from the cabalist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a cabalist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cabalists spell equals 10 + the spell level + the cabalists Intelligence modifier. A cabalist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table Cabalist. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). A cabalists selection of spells is limited. A cabalist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the cabalists choice. At each new cabalist level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table Cabalist Spells Known (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a cabalist knows is not affected by his Intelligence score. The numbers on Table Cabalist Spells Known are fixed.). These new spells can be common spells chosen from the cabalist spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the cabalist has gained some understanding of through study. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third cabalist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a cabalist can learn a single new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the cabalist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spells level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level cabalist spell he can cast. A cabalist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Through secretive rites, the cabalist has found the means to channel eldritch might through his very being. His body and mind are forever altered by this ritual, but such a power cannot be controlled all at once. Each of these potentials is called a binding. The cabalists bindings grant him a +1 insight bonus to specific checks, which vary depending on the binding used. The bonus for both bindings increases to +2 at 7th level and to +3 at 13th level. A cabalist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table Cabalist Spells Known under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Starting at 2nd level, the cabalist discovers methods to further channel the powers of the unknown, gleaning insights from beyond to bind further eldritch strength. The cabalist gains two insights at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of twelve insights at 17th level. Insights are separated into three levels lesser, greater, and master, which are further divided by the binding type the insight applies to (formless body or opened mind). He only gains the effects of an insight while he is using the matching binding for that insight. At first, the cabalist can only select lesser insights. Upon reaching 8th level, he instead gains greater insights, and at 14th level he learns master insights. An insight cannot be selected more than once. Each time a cabalist gains his two insights for a particular level, he must select one for each of his two bindings one for formless body, and one for opened mind. He can select a lower-level insight, if so desired. If an insight calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cabalists level + his Intelligence modifier. A full list of Cabalist Insights can be found here. Beginning at 3rd level, the cabalist learns how to convert traditional magic into more methodicalbut riskyritualistic incantations. The cabalist learns a special occult ritual, as detailed on the Ritual Spell page (for more details, see the Occult Rituals section in Chapter 5 of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Occult Adventures). Upon learning this ritual, the cabalist selects two spells of 1st-level or higher from the cabalist spell list. These spells cannot have a casting time longer than 1 minute. They do not have to be spells he knows, but they must be of a level he is capable of casting. The cabalist can use his ritual to cast the selected spells at-will. For every three levels gained after 3rd, the cabalist can select two more spells from the cabalist spell list to be castable in this manner, to a maximum of twelve spells at 18th level. Additionally, whenever he gains a level in the cabalist class, he can exchange one of his chosen ritual spells for a different one of the same level. Spells added to the cabalist spell list by means of feats, magic items, racial abilities, and so on cannot be selected for ritual magic. At 3rd level, a cabalists experience with occult magics makes him better at understanding them. He gains a +1 bonus to any checks to learn an occult ritual or skill checks made to perform one (including his ritual magic ability). This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels gained after 3rd, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. At 4th level, the cabalists body more quickly recovers from injury. He recovers twice as many hit points and ability damage from resting than normal. If he rests for a full day, he also recovers 1 point of ability drain from each of his drained ability scores, if any. At 7th level, the cabalist may change bindings with barely a thought. He can enter into a binding as a free action on his turn. He may still only change bindings once per round. At 10th level, the cabalists expertise allows him to cast rituals more safely. As long as he is the primary caster of an occult ritual, all casters in the ritual take half as much damage from any backlash or failure effects, and they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throws against the backlash or failure effects (if they require a saving throw). Starting at 13th level, the cabalists mind cannot be read nor his memories altered unless he allows it. If a creature attempts to read his thoughts without his permission, its mind is flooded with paradoxical and maddening revelations. It must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cabalists level + his Intelligence modifier) or be confused for 1d4 rounds. At 16th level, the cabalist can swiftly perform ritual magic. As long as he is the primary caster, he reduces the time it takes to perform an occult ritual by half. For a typical ritual (including his ritual magic ability) this means it takes 5 minutes per level of the ritual instead of 10, while longer rituals take 30 minutes per level instead of 1 hour per level. The time between making skill checks to perform an occult ritual is reduced by the same amount. At 20th level, the cabalist unlocks true power, finally able to completely channel the powers of the unknown, if only briefly. Once per day, he may enter into a special binding which grants him the effects of both formless body and opened mind at the same time. Any insights he has that normally can only be used once per binding (such as dual realities) can instead be used once per round without needing to change bindings first. Once he enters into this binding, he cannot voluntarily leave it. This binding lasts for a number of minutes equal to the cabalists Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), after which the cabalist is reduced to 1 hit point (if his current hit points are higher than 1), staggered for 1 round, then exhausted. He cannot use eldritch nexus if he is already fatigued or exhausted, and the binding ends early if he is knocked unconscious or killed (if ended early, he is still staggered, exhausted, and reduced to 1 hit point, as mentioned above).||upon reaching 19th level, a cabalist has become an authority of the occult. he reduces the time it takes to learn a ritual by half. he no longer requires secondary casters for any ritual he performs, and if he chooses to include them (usually to from the ritual) he may make any number of the secondary casters skill checks himself. finally, he is immune to the failure effects of any ritual he performs, though secondary casters are still affected as normal.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Saboteur|General, Metaconstruction|Even the smallest of actions can have far-reaching consequences. A hundred stones can build a fortress; a single loose stone can send it crashing down. A thousand blades can protect a king; a single blade can topple a nation. When subtlety of thought and action is necessary, a saboteur answers the call. Masters of deception and infiltration, saboteurs have all of the tools necessary to gain entrance to the most well-defended bastions and complete their mission. With specialized tricks to suit their needs and a variety of magical traps at their disposal, a well-prepared saboteur can accomplish any goal with none the wiser. Role Saboteurs are masters of trickery and sabotage, bypassing sentries and wards with ease while placing their own magical devices to trap unsuspecting foes. A saboteurs variety of skills and abilities lets them improvise when needed, but a saboteur that properly prepares can be a truly dangerous combatant. Alignment Any Hit Die d8 Starting Age Self-taught Starting Wealth 4d6  10 gp (average 140 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The saboteurs class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks Per Level 6 + Int modifier. All of the following are class features of the saboteur. Saboteurs are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, net, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and with all firearms. They are proficient in light armors, but not with shields. Unlike most trapsmiths, a saboteur can create complex, magically-enhanced traps with minimal materials, imparting her own arcane power into the trap to make a wide variety of effects. In many ways, saboteur traps behave like spells in trap form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like dispel magic using the saboteurs level as the caster level. A saboteur can create only a certain number of traps of each level per day. Her base daily allotment of traps is given on Table Saboteur. In addition, she receives bonus traps per day if she has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day. When a saboteur creates a trap, she assembles it with carefully-constructed gears, wires, and parts, imparting it with magical power to create wondrous effects. Each saboteur creates her traps differently; a trap made by one saboteur cannot be set or detonated remotely by another person, even another saboteur, though they can be disarmed via Disable Device like a normal trap. A trap, once created, remains usable for 1 day before the parts need to be repaired, so a saboteur must re-prepare her traps every day. Creating a trap takes 1 minute of workmost saboteurs prepare many traps at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but its not uncommon for a saboteur to keep some (or even all) of her daily trap slots open so that she can prepare traps in the field as needed. Although the saboteur doesnt actually cast spells, she does have an assembly list that determines what traps she can create. A saboteur can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on her assembly list, but not spell-completion items (unless she uses Use Magic Device to do so). A trap is cast by setting itsetting a trap is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and it must be placed in an open, adjacent square to the saboteur. A trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in the same area as another saboteur trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding, and once placed cannot be moved. All saboteur traps are Type Magical, Trigger Location, and Reset None. Once a trap is placed, it remains set for 1 hour per caster level, after which it falls apart harmlessly. A saboteur can have a number of traps set equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); if she tries to set another trap when at this maximum, the oldest trap set deactivates harmlessly. When the saboteur would regain her trap slots for the day, she does not regain the slots for any trap that is still set and active. When the trap is triggered, the spell comes into effect on the creature that triggered it (even if that creature is the saboteur herself). If the spell targets one or more creatures, the trap targets as many creatures within range of the spell as possible, starting with the creature that triggered the trap and continuing to the next nearest creature, using the traps location as the point of origin and the saboteurs bonuses for attack rolls. If the spell affects an area, it comes into effect centered on the traps location or originating from the traps space (in the case of spells with a point of origin like burning hands), aimed to strike as many targets as possible with the traps effect, even if the spell could normally only be centered on the saboteur. Effects that require space to appear (such as wall of ice) appear in the nearest available space within the spells range. If the saboteur sees the trap trigger, she can instead designate targets or aim the area of effect as desired within the limitations of the traps effects, though the effect still originates from the traps space and must include the creature that triggered the trap in its area of effect or as one of its targets (where applicable). If an effect has a duration of concentration, it can only be concentrated on if the saboteur has line of sight to the traps effect; otherwise, it lasts as if concentrated on for 1 round + 1 round per five saboteur levels obtained, up to its normal maximum duration. Any extra abilities the trap has that can be used by concentration or require action on the saboteurs part, such as moving a flaming sphere, cannot be used unless the saboteur can see the effect and is within its normal range. In addition to her traps being triggered normally, the saboteur can use a move action once per round to detonate a trap within 30 feet of her that she can see. When detonating a trap this way, she does not have to include herself as one of its targets or within in its area of effect. She may disarm one of her traps within 5 feet of her as a standard action with no check needed. The saboteur uses her level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level. Creating traps consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificantcomparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the placing of that trap. Spells that normally have a focus or divine focus requirement do not have a those requirements when made as a saboteur trap. A saboteur can prepare a trap of any assembly she knows. To learn or use a trap, a saboteur must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the traps level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a saboteurs trap is 10 + the trap level + the saboteurs Intelligence modifier. The Difficulty Class of Perception checks to locate a saboteur trap or Disable Device checks to disable a saboteur trap is equal to the traps save DC + 10. A saboteur may know any number of assemblies. She stores her assemblies in a special tome called an assembly book. She must refer to this book whenever she prepares a trap but not when she sets it. A saboteur begins play with two 1st level assemblies of her choice, plus a number of additional assemblies equal to her Intelligence modifier. At each new saboteur level, she gains two new assemblies of any level that she can create. A saboteur can also add assemblies to her book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs and time requirements. A saboteur can study a wizards spellbook to learn any assemblies that are equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from an assembly book. A saboteur does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them. Saboteurs adapt as needed based on the foes and obstacles they face. At 1st level, a saboteur learns how to mark a creature she can see as a move action. When she does, she gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls against that target. The bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every four saboteur levels thereafter. In addition, she chooses one of the following types of mark to apply to her target. She gains bonuses to additional checks or statistics based on the type of mark used. The bonus is equal to the bonus to her attack rolls against the marked target Once she has chosen which type of mark to apply to her target, she cannot change it. The mark lasts until the target dies, the saboteur dismisses the mark (a swift action), or for 24 hours, whichever comes first. She can choose to mark a dead creature (or leave her mark on a creature that dies, rather than having it automatically end); usually this is done to disguise herself as the deceased target with charlatans mark or to learn about the target with informants mark. Once a target has been marked, it cannot be marked again for 24 hours. The saboteur can only maintain one marked target at a time. A saboteur adds 1/2 her level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A saboteur can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. Rather than learning a broad spectrum of techniques as a fighter, or a plethora of magical abilities as a wizard, a saboteur learns a few specialized tricks to better accomplish her goals. Starting at 2nd level, a saboteur gains one saboteur trick. She gains an additional trick for every two levels of saboteur attained after 2nd level. A saboteur cannot select an individual trick more than once. If a trick calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the saboteurs level + her Intelligence modifier, unless otherwise stated. A full list of saboteur tricks can be found here. At 3rd level, a saboteur becomes skilled at spotting hidden alcoves and traps, even passively. Whenever she passes within 10 feet of a trap, hidden passage, or secret door, she can attempt an immediate Perception check to notice the trap or passage. This check should be made in secret by the GM. Starting at 5th level, a saboteur becomes adept at quickly disabling traps and other devices. It takes the saboteur half the normal time to perform a Disable Device check (minimum 1 round). If she attempts to use Disable Device to open a lock that would take a full-round action to open, she instead can do so as a standard action. She can also trigger a trap she has placed within 30 feet of her as a swift action, whether that trap is a saboteur trap or a mechanical trap she has placed. At 7th level, a saboteurs ability to mark a target improves. She can now maintain two marked targets at once, and marking a target can be done as a swift action. She may now change which type of marks are applied to her marked targets as a swift action, but only once per marked target in a 24 hour period. She can change all of her marks with the same swift action. At 9th level, a saboteur learns how to set her traps from a distance. As part of the standard action to place a saboteur trap, she can throw the trap with a free hand to setup the trap in a single unoccupied square within 20 feet. Alternatively, she can affix the trap to a piece of ammunition (bolt, arrow, bullet, etc.) or a thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap from further away or use it as a direct attack. Drawing the trap, attaching the trap to the projectile, and firing it in this manner is a full-round action. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the saboteur had set the trap in that square. If fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies). A trap that is set with this ability (either thrown or affixed to a ranged weapon) has its saving throw DC lowered by 2. A trap that is affixed to a ranged weapon and misses its target breaks apart harmlessly. To Create Beginning at 11th level, a saboteur can combine the mechanical parts and magical energy of her weaker traps to create more powerful traps. When preparing her traps, she can give up a number of trap slots whose total trap levels is greater than or equal to the value shown in Table Combined Arms to create a trap of the level shown. For example, if she wants to create an ice storm trap (a 4th level trap), she would have to give up a number of trap slots whose total levels is at least five or more. This can be any combination of trap slots, such as a 3rd level trap slot and a 2nd level trap slot, five 1st level trap slots, or some other combination. She cannot give up a trap slot whose level is equal to or higher than the trap being created. She can only use combined arms to create a trap she is capable of making. Starting at 15th level, a saboteurs mark becomes especially potent. She can maintain three marked targets and can mark all targets with a single swift action. Instead of keeping multiple marked targets, she can instead mark a target with two different marks. She cannot have any other marked targets while she does so. The attack bonus from her two marks do not stack. At 17th level, a saboteur doubles the number of saboteur traps she can have placed at once, allowing her to maintain a number of traps equal to twice her Intelligence bonus (minimum 2). At 19th level, the saboteur can complete any Disable Device check that would take 1 round or longer in a single standard action. When using Disable Device to open a lock that would take a full-round action to open, she can instead do so as a swift action. She can also trigger a trap she has placed within 30 feet of her as a free action, whether that trap is a saboteur trap or a mechanical trap. She can still only trigger one trap each round in this manner. At 20th level, the saboteur learns her signature, a special trick that sets her skill far apart from a less experienced saboteur. She gains one of the following masters tricks of her choice. The masters trick is an exceptionally powerful ability, the sort of skill spoken of in tales of legendary thieves and agents. A full list of master's tricks can be found here.||at 13th level, a saboteurs evasion improves. this ability works like evasion, except that while the saboteur still takes no damage on a successful reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. a helpless saboteur does not gain the of improved evasion.|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
Saboteur Tricks|General|Rather than learning a broad spectrum of techniques as a fighter, or a plethora of magical abilities as a wizard, a saboteur learns a few specialized tricks to better accomplish her goals. Starting at 2nd level, a saboteur gains one saboteur trick. She gains an additional trick for every two levels of saboteur attained after 2nd level. A saboteur cannot select an individual trick more than once. If a trick calls for a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the saboteurs level + her Intelligence modifier, unless otherwise stated. Always Prepared (Ex) A saboteur with this trick always has what she needs. She may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 50 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into a backpack, including potions and scrolls (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, she may retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, she can retrieve no more items until she restocks her equipment with 1 hour of work and spending an amount of gold to bring her total up to 50 gp per class level. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Ambush (Ex) During a surprise round, opponents are always considered flat-footed against the saboteur, even if they have already acted. If the saboteur strikes an opponent with a weapon attack before they have acted in combat, the target remains flat-footed during the next round (though it can act), its place in the initiative order is reduced by the saboteurs Intelligence bonus (minimum 0), and she adds 1/2 her level to the damage roll. The penalty to initiative does not stack. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Assassinate (Ex) The saboteur can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. Assassinate can only be used on a target marked with assassins mark. To attempt to assassinate a target, the saboteur must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the saboteur strikes her target and it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the saboteur as an enemy. If the attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise, the target takes the damage as normal and is then immune to that saboteurs assassinate ability for 24 hours. The saboteur must be at least 12th level before selecting this trick. Beguilers Arcana (Sp) The saboteur learns a handful of magical knacks. She learns four spells from the following list arcane mark, conjure tool, dancing lights, daze, detect magic, ghost sound, light, lullaby, mage hand, mending, message, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic, siftAPG, sparkAPG, or unwitting allyAPG. The saboteur can cast these spells at-will, using her saboteur level as her caster level. The DC of these spells is equal to 10 + her Intelligence bonus. Certain Strike (Ex) When the saboteur attacks the target of her assassins mark and misses, she can use a free action to re-roll her attack roll once. She must use the second result, even if it is worse, and may only do so once per target in a 24 hour period. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Charming Words (Sp) The saboteur is supernaturally compelling. By spending 1 minute conversing with the target of her charlatans mark, the saboteur can affect it as by her choice of charm monster or suggestion (save DC equal to her saboteur trick save DC, instead of their normal DC). This a language-dependent effect, and the effect ends early if the saboteurs mark is removed from the creature. Whether it makes its save or not, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours. The saboteur must be at least 14th level before selecting this trick. Combat Insight (Ex) The saboteur gains a +1 insight bonus to saving throws against effects created by the target of her informants mark, but only if she has identified the target with a Knowledge check. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 16th level. When she scores a critical hit with a weapon attack against the target of her informants mark, she can re-roll a Knowledge check to identify the target, letting her possibly succeed on a previously failed check or gain additional information about her target. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Convincing Lies (Su) The saboteurs falsehoods fool even magical detection. She is warded against magical means of detecting lies or forcing her to speak the truth as if she was under the effect of a glibness spell using her saboteur level as her caster level. Unlike the typical glibness spell, she does not receive any bonuses to her Bluff check from this effect. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Deadly Strikes (Ex) Whenever the saboteur confirms a critical hit against the target of her assassins mark, if the target has regeneration or fast healing, the creature loses its regeneration and/or fast healing for a number of rounds equal to the critical multiplier of the weapon she used. Creatures whose regeneration always functions are immune to this ability. The saboteur must be at least 16th level before selecting this trick. Debilitating Mark (Ex) The saboteurs marked targets take a -1 penalty to saving throws against her traps and to their Spell Resistance against her traps (including mechanical traps). The penalty increases to -2 at 10th level and to -3 at 16th level. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Deep Wounds (Ex) When the saboteur strikes the target of her assassins mark with a weapon attack, she inflicts 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage increases to 2 bleed damage at 10th level and 3 bleed damage at 16th level. The bleed damage can stack, up to an amount of bleed damage equal to the saboteurs level. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Deft Steps (Ex) The saboteur no longer provokes attacks of opportunity for movement from the target of her duelists mark. The saboteur must be at least 14th level before selecting this trick. Disguise Mastery (Ex) A saboteur with this trick can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1. This reduction stacks. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Distraction (Ex) When the saboteur successfully hits the target of her charlatans mark with a weapon attack, she can cause it be distracted as a free action. The next time the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates the effect. If the target was denied their Dexterity bonus to AC when hit, this effect applies to all rolls it makes until the end of the saboteurs next turn, instead, and a successful save reduces it to just a single roll. Whether or not it saves, the creature cannot be affected again for 24 hours. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Doppelgangers Visage (Sp) After the saboteur has marked a target with her charlatans mark, she can spend a full-round action to take on the targets persona, as if using both disguise self and vocal alterationUM to look and sound like the marked target. The effects last until the saboteur marks a different target, 24 hours have passed, or she dispels the visage (a free action). The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Duality (Su) A saboteur with this trick can literally be in two places at once. As a swift action, she can split herself into two individuals, as the spell bilocationOA. Her duplicate must appear within 30 feet, but otherwise the effect works as long as it remains within 500 feet of her. The saboteur can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to half her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1); this duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The saboteur must be at least 16th level before selecting this trick. Duelists Parry (Ex) The saboteur can parry an opponents strikes. When the target of her duelists mark makes an attack roll against her (either in melee or at range) with a weapon attack or natural weapon, she can use an attack of opportunity to parry the attack. She makes an attack roll at her full base attack bonus; if her attack roll is equal to or higher than the attack roll of the opponent, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than the saboteur, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty on her attack roll. The saboteur must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. She may only parry a single attack each round from each of her marked targets. If she uses a ranged weapon to parry, she can only parry a ranged attack. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Elude Divination (Sp) A saboteur with this trick is difficult to track with divination effects. She is affected by a constant nondetection spell (as if cast on herself), using her saboteur level as her caster level. She can suspend or resume this ability as a standard action; if its dispelled she cannot resume it for 1 minute. The saboteur must be at least 12th level before selecting this trick. Enemy of my Enemy (Ex) The saboteur can sow discord with simple words. Whenever the saboteur makes a Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a creature, she can adjust its attitude by up to three steps, rather than just two. In addition, she can use Diplomacy to worsen a creatures attitude towards another. This works just like influencing attitude, but in reverse; the DC of the Diplomacy check is based on the target attitude she wishes to shift the creature to (for example, making a creature unfriendly towards another would require a Diplomacy check of 20 + the creatures Charisma modifier). The creature she is influencing must be able to either see the second creature or know of the second creature to be influenced in this way. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Extended Setup (Ex) A saboteur with this trick can use her ranged setup class feature to throw a trap within 40 feet. Her traps no longer take a penalty to their DC for being placed with ranged setup. The saboteur must be at least 10th level before selecting this trick. Feign Death (Ex) As an immediate action when the saboteur takes damage from any source, she can choose to feign death. She falls to the ground prone, appearing as if dead to outside observers. She makes a Bluff check with a +10 bonus to appear as dead to others, which can be opposed by a Perception, Sense Motive, or Heal check to notice she is not actually deceased. She can maintain this appearance as long as she likes, though hindrances such as the need to sleep or eat can hinder this check. Subsequent attempts to feign death against the same creatures cause a stacking -10 penalty to her Bluff check per attempt. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Firearms Training (Ex) The saboteur gains a grit pool, as the gunslinger ability. However, the saboteur uses her Intelligence modifier to determine the size of her grit pool (minimum 1). This grit pool does not stack with any other grit pool she may obtain (such as from gunslinger); only the larger of the two pools can be used. She also gains a 1st-level deed of her choice from the gunslinger class. Focused Strike (Ex) The saboteur can make singular, well-placed hits. Whenever she makes only a single weapon attack on her turn (by taking the attack action, using the Spring Attack or Vital Strike feats, etc.), she can declare that attack as a focused strike. If it hits, she deals an additional 3d6 damage. This damage is the same type as the weapon and is precision damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit. The damage increases by 1d6 for every two levels gained after 6th, to a maximum of 10d6 damage at 20th level. Once she uses a focused strike, she cannot make any other attacks on her turn (except for attacks of opportunity), even if she has an ability that would allow her to do so. If used when launching a trap with the ranged setup ability, the number of dice is reduced by half, rounded down (max 5d6). The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Forgetful Exchange (Sp) A saboteur with this trick can cause her targets to forget ever speaking with her. As a swift action, she can force a creature within 30 feet to make a Will save. If the creature fails its saving throw, on a subsequent turn the saboteur can use another swift action to cause the creature to forget all events that took place since it failed its save, as if subjected to a modify memory spell. The saboteur knows if the target fails its saving throw, but the target of the effect does not. The target must remained marked the entire time. She can use this ability multiple times per day, but can only erase a total number of minutes of memory equal to her saboteur level + her Intelligence modifier. This duration can be divided across multiple uses of the trick, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The saboteur must be at least 12th level before selecting this trick. Glamered Arms (Su) All weapons and armor the saboteur wields or carries are shrouded in illusion, allowing the saboteur to change their appearance as if they had the glamered special weapon or armor property. At 12th level, effects that would see through the glamered property (such as true seeing) do not reveal her equipments true form. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Hide in Plain Sight (Su) A saboteur with this trick can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light (or darker), a saboteur can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow. The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Illusory Retreat (Su) Whenever the saboteur takes the withdraw action, she turns invisible and leaves an illusory duplicate in her place, as the spell mislead. However, the invisibility provided only lasts 1 round, and the major image created cannot be concentrated on. The save DC is equal to her trick DC, as opposed to the normal DC of mislead. The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Influence (Ex) A saboteur with this trick can easily persuade and deceive her targets. She can roll twice on a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check she makes against the target of her charlatans mark, or roll twice on a Bluff or Disguise check she made to pass herself as her target, and take the better result. She can only do this once per target she marks with her charlatans mark in a 24 hour period. Intercept (Ex) The saboteur can make an attack of opportunity against the target of her duelists mark when it moves into any square threatened by her, regardless of whether that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Into Thin Air (Sp) As a move action, the saboteur can vanish from sight, as the spell invisibility. This effect can be used for a number of minutes each day equal to the saboteurs level; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 12th level, she can instead use this ability to grant herself greater invisibility, but each round spent invisible in such a manner counts as 1 minute of this abilitys duration. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Intuitive Mark (Ex) A saboteur with this trick can mark a creature with her marked target class feature, even if she has already done so that day. This doesnt let her maintain more marks than her normal limit. She may do so once per day, plus an additional time each day for every two levels above 10th. The saboteur must be at least 10th level before selecting this trick. Lasting Traps (Ex) The saboteurs traps have a more robust construction. When she places a saboteur trap, she can have it remain set for up to 1 week, instead of only 1 hour per level. A trap set in this manner counts as three traps for the purpose of how many traps the saboteur can have placed at once. The saboteur must be at least 14th level before selecting this trick. Masterful Sabotage (Ex) The saboteur is especially proficient at disabling traps, even among other saboteurs. Whenever she disarms a trap using Disable Device, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Mobile Setup (Ex) Whenever the saboteur takes the withdraw action, she can also place a saboteur trap as part of that action at any point during her movement. The saboteur must be at least 12th level before selecting this trick. Nimble (Ex) Once per turn when the saboteur successfully makes a weapon attack against the target of her duelists mark, she may take a 5-foot step. She may do this even if she moved or took a 5-foot step this round, but her total movement in a round cannot exceed her base speed. Opportune Strikes (Ex) Whenever a target of the saboteurs duelists mark misses her with an attack, that target provokes an attack of opportunity from her. A target can only provoke one attack per round from the saboteur in this way. The saboteur must be at least 10th level before selecting this trick. Piercing Strikes (Ex) When attacking the target of her assassins mark, the saboteurs weapons are considered magic, silver, and cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. At 12th level, her weapons are considered one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). She can change which alignment type her weapons function as each time she marks a target, but the type chosen must match one axis of the saboteurs alignment. At 16th level, the saboteur ignores the first 5 points of damage reduction possessed by the target of her assassins mark, regardless of type. The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Poison Brewer (Ex) The saboteur can create poisons cheaply. When she gains this trick, she chooses one ability score except for Constitution. Each day when she prepares her traps, she can use an alchemists lab to brew a number of poisons equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at no cost. The poisons effect is based on which ability score she chose (Poisoninjury; save Fort DC equal to the saboteurs trick DC; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 damage to the chosen ability score; cure 1 save). These poisons last for only 24 hours before becoming inert. At 12th and 18th levels, she can select another ability score to damage with her poisons, and the damage die increases by one step (to 1d4 at 12th level, and to 1d6 at 18th level). She chooses which ability score from those available to her that a given poison damages when she creates it. The saboteur must be at least 6th level before selecting this trick. Poison Expert (Ex) The saboteur gains a bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks involving poisons equal to half her saboteur level; this does not stack with the bonus from the tinkerer saboteur trick. In addition, she can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemists lab and a Craft (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poisons DC. If successful, the poisons type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is ruined. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick. Potent Toxins (Ex) Poisons created by the saboteur are especially lethal against particular foes. When the saboteur takes this trick, she selects a single creature type (and subtype, if she chooses humanoid or outsider) except for construct, similar to a rangers favored enemy. Poisons that the saboteur creates work against those creatures even if they would otherwise be immune to poison, ability damage, or effects that require a Fortitude save. The effects of the poison might still have no effect, depending on what she uses them for (such as trying to inflict Constitution damage to an undead). She selects another creature type (and subtype, where applicable) for every four levels gained past 8th. The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Quick Hands (Ex) The saboteur gains Quick Draw as a bonus feat. She adds half her saboteur level on Sleight of Hand checks to hide a weapon, and drawing a hidden weapon becomes a swift action for her. This bonus to Sleight of Hand checks does not stack with the bonus on Sleight of Hand checks provided by charlatans mark. Salvage Trap (Ex) The saboteur can salvage traps for use in construction of her own traps. Whenever she successfully disarms a trap, she can spend 10 minutes salvaging materials from it. She gains an amount of raw materials with a gold value equal to 200 gp x the traps CR or 20% of the traps construction cost, whichever is lower. These raw materials can only be used to construct traps, either mundane or magical in nature, but cannot be used as material components for her saboteur trap class feature. A saboteur can only salvage a mechanical trap, not a magic device trap or a spell trap. Secret Passage (Sp) A saboteur with this trick can use magic to enter secure areas. As a full-round action, she can touch a wall to affect it as a passwall spell, using her saboteur level as her caster level. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). At 16th level, she can use three of her daily uses of this ability to instead create the effects of a phase door spell. The saboteur must be at least 10th level before selecting this trick. Spell Thief (Sp) A saboteur with this trick can steal magical effects. When she hits an opponent with a weapon attack, as a free action she can siphon some of that targets ongoing spell effects, as an arcana theftUM spell. Alternatively, she can do this when attacking a magic item, transferring the magical effects of the item to her own possessions as a siphon enhancement spell. Both of these effects use her saboteur level as her caster level and her saboteur trick DC in place of the spells normal save DC. She can do this once per day, plus an additional time per day for every two levels beyond 12th. The saboteur must be at least 12th level before selecting this trick. Spot Weakness (Ex) Whenever the saboteur makes only a single weapon attack on her turn against the target of her informants mark (by taking the attack action, using the Spring Attack or Vital Strike feats, etc.), she doubles the critical threat range of that attack. This does not stack with other effects that improve critical threat range, such as Improved Critical. If the target is one she has identified with a Knowledge check, she adds her Intelligence bonus to her damage roll and rolls to confirm critical hits (minimum +0). The saboteur must be at least 8th level before selecting this trick. Tinkerer (Ex) The saboteur gains a bonus on all Craft checks equal to half her saboteur level, and the time it takes for her to create or set mechanical traps is halved. At 8th level, she no longer takes any penalty for using improvised tools for Disable Device or Craft checks. Trackless (Ex) The saboteur leaves no footprints or scent, as if under the constant effect of a pass without trace spell. In addition, the saboteur can move at full speed while using the Stealth skill without penalty. Underhanded Tactics (Ex) Whenever the saboteur hits the target of her charlatans mark with a weapon attack, she can strike it a vulnerable spot, sickening for 1 round. If the target was denied their Dexterity bonus to AC when struck, it is sickened for 1d3+1 rounds, instead. This duration does not stack. The saboteur must be at least 10th level before selecting this trick. Unreadable (Sp) The saboteur is an enigma to outside divinations. She is treated as though under the effect of a mind blank spell, using her saboteur level as her caster level. She can suspend or resume this ability as a standard action; if its dispelled she cannot resume it for 1 minute. The saboteur must be at least 16th level before selecting this trick. Versatile Assembly (Ex) The saboteur gains a bonus metaconstruction feat of her choice. At 10th level, she can spontaneously apply the effects of her chosen metaconstruction feat to saboteur traps she places. How many times per day she can do this is based on the level adjustment the metaconstruction feat has on her saboteur traps a feat with a +1 level adjustment can be used three times per day, a feat with a +2 level adjustment can be used twice a day, and a feat with a +3 level adjustment can be used once per day. She cannot use this effect with the Heighten Trap metaconstruction feat. The saboteur must be at least 4th level before selecting this trick.|sniper (ex) the saboteur gains precise shot as a bonus feat, even if she doesnt meet the . when she uses the stealth skill to snipe, she only suffers a -10 penalty to stealth, instead of -20.|shifting aura (su) the saboteur can mask her true alignment, even fooling magical senses. as a standard action, she can choose to detect as a specific alignment. spells and effects that rely on her alignment (such as detect good or a paladins smite evil) treat her as if she were the chosen alignment. this applies to both helpful and harmful. the effect lasts until the saboteur dismisses it (a standard action). the saboteur must be at least 14th level before selecting this trick.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Warden - Secrets|General|A wardens devotion to nature is rewarded with knowledge of its hidden mysteries. When he reaches 2nd level and every three warden levels thereafter, he gains a single secret from the list below. A secret cannot be selected more than once. If a secret calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wardens level + his Wisdom modifier unless otherwise noted. Alleviate (Su) When the warden uses remedy on a creature, it is no longer sickened. At 8th level, it is no longer nauseated, as well. Bond of Vitality (Su) An invisible thread of protection allows a warden to intercept harm from his allies. As a standard action, the warden can form a bond of vitality with a willing creature within 30 feet of himself. Whenever that creature takes damage, the amount it takes is reduced by 1/4 the wardens level. If the creature is inside one of the wardens wards, it is reduced by 1/2 the wardens level, instead. The warden takes all damage prevented this way, and cannot reduce this redirected damage by any means. He can maintain a number of bonds equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Bonds last until the warden is reduced to 0 hit points, the bonded creature dies, the distance between them exceeds medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), or the warden ends it as an immediate action (the warden can end one or several bonds at once with the same action). The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Cleansing (Sp) The warden can spend a use of remedy to cast remove curse as a spell-like ability. This has the same range of his remedy class feature. The warden must be at least 8th level before learning this secret. Convalescence (Sp) The warden can spend 2 uses of remedy to cast restoration as a standard action and without material components, using the same range as his remedy class feature. He cannot use this to dispel a permanent negative level. The warden must be at least 11th level before learning this secret. Cycle of Growth (Sp) The warden can bless plant life to spread wildly or prune it for their long-term health. He can use both diminish plants and plant growth at-will as spell-like abilities using his warden level as his caster level. The warden must be at least 11th level before learning this secret. Eyes of the Wild (Sp) The warden can cast both commune with nature and find the path (targeting himself only) at will as spell-like abilities, but must use their normal casting time. The warden must be at least 14th level before learning this secret. Forest Traveler (Sp) The warden can use tree stride as a spell-like ability number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), plus an additional use per day when he reaches 14th and 20th levels. At 14th level, he can use two uses of this ability to instead cast transport via plants. The warden must be at least 8th level before learning this secret. Green Thumb (Ex) The warden gains Cultivate Magic PlantsUW as a bonus feat without meeting its requirements and can ignore the spell requirements in the creation of magical plants. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Grow Anew (Sp) The warden can spend 6 uses of remedy to cast resurrection without material components, using his warden level as his caster level. He must use its normal casting time and range. The warden must be at least 17th level before learning this secret. Guardians Reflex (Ex) A warden with this secret can more ably react to his opponents. He gains a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls made as part of an attack of opportunity and can make an additional attack of opportunity each round. These additional attacks stack with those gained from the Combat Reflexes feat (if he has it). At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, the bonus to attack and damage rolls and the number of attacks of opportunity he can make increase by 1, to a total of a +4 bonus and four additional attacks of opportunity per round. Guided Hand (Ex) A consistent assault can fell even the toughest foes. Whenever the warden takes the attack action to make a single attack, he adds half his warden level to the damage dealt. This damage is the same type as the weapon used and is multiplied on a critical hit. In addition, if the warden uses the Vital Strike feat (or its variants), he multiplies the additional damage by the number of dice rolled by those feats twice for Vital Strike, three times for Improved Vital Strike, or four times for Greater Vital Strike. The damage increase for Vital Strike (and its variants) is applied before factoring in critical hits. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Hidden Trails (Ex) The warden gains woodland stride, as the druid class feature of the same name, and does not leave a trail while traveling through natural terrains (as pass without trace) unless he so desires. At 8th level, he may move at full speed through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated, including areas that would impart the entangled condition, and his ability to leave no trail while traveling may be extended to all of his allies, so long as they remain within 30 feet of him while traveling. Leyline Walker (Su) The wardens wild step improves. If he uses his wild step to teleport into one of his own wards (but not a ward from another warden), he can do so from any distance. Additionally, the warden can use his wild step as a standard action to bring a single willing, adjacent creature along with him when he teleports. The brought creature must end its teleportation adjacent to the warden and inside the destination ward. The warden must be at least 14th level before learning this secret. Like the Reed (Sp) The warden can bend and twist wood. He can cast warp wood and wood shape as spell-like abilities at-will using his warden level as his caster level and secret DC for the spell DC. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Monster Hunter (Ex) New threats must be known before they can be properly dealt with. The warden adds half his level as a bonus to Knowledge checks made to identify creatures and can make such checks untrained. This does not stack with the bonus from nature lore. Mountains Gift (Ex) The steadfast spirits of the mountain bless the warden with a climb speed equal to his base speed (including a +8 racial bonus to Climb checks). The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Mystic Blade (Su) The warden can call upon the myriad spirits of the wild to inhabit his weapon and give him strength. As a swift action, the warden can grant a weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every three levels beyond 8th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing weapon enhancements to a maximum of +5. Alternatively, the enhancement bonus can be used to add any of the following weapon properties brutal, defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, glacial, guardian, icy burst, impact, lifesurge, limning, merciful, shock, and shocking burst. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the propertys base price modifier. Duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. Bonuses granted by mystic blade do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the warden. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The warden must be at least 8th level before learning this secret. Natural Order (Sp) The warden can spend 2 uses of remedy to cast break enchantment as a standard action, using his warden level as his caster level for the effect. This has the same range as his remedy class feature but only targets a single creature. The warden must be at least 14th level before learning this secret. Naturalize (Sp) The warden can spend 1 use of remedy to cast dispel magic as a standard action, using his warden level as his caster level for the effect. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Oceans Gift (Ex) The mysterious spirits of the ocean bless the warden with a swim speed equal to his base speed (including a +8 racial bonus to Swim checks). This also grants the warden the ability to breathe underwater. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Prevention (Su) An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The warden can spend 1 use of remedy as a standard action to grant a creature 1d6 temporary hit points per two warden levels; this has the same range as remedy. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour and do not stack. Once a creature has received this effect, they cannot receive it again for 1 hour from the same warden. Renewal (Sp) The warden can spend a use of remedy to cast remove blindness/deafness as a spell-like ability. This has the same range of his remedy class feature. The warden must be at least 8th level before learning this secret. Return to Nature (Su) The wardens touch can undo artifice, making way for nature to reclaim it. The warden can touch an object or construct as a standard action to inflict 1d6 damage per two warden levels (max 10d6) to the target. A Fortitude save by the touched object or creature halves the damage dealt. Once an object or a construct is affected by this ability (whether it saves or not) it cannot be targeted again for 24 hours. Sacred Grove (Sp) A warden with this secret can conjure an aspect of the hidden wellsprings where spirits rest. The warden can cast grove of respiteAPG as a spell-like ability at-will. When he does, he can optionally create a lodge for his allies, as a secure shelter spell, inside the groves area. Creating a sacred grove takes 10 minutes and uses the wardens level as his caster level for all effects. This can only be used outdoors, and he may only have one sacred grove conjured at a time; using it again causes any existing grove to vanish. The warden must be at least 8th level before learning this secret. Shamans Cure (Sp) The warden may spend one use of his remedy ability to cast his choice of either remove disease or neutralize poison; both effects have the same range as his remedy class feature. Both use the wardens level as his caster level for their effects. The warden must be at least 5th level before learning this secret. Sharpened Senses (Ex) The wardens senses hone like that of a wild animal. He gains both low-light vision and the scent ability. Thread of Life (Su) The glow of life becomes visible to the warden. He gains lifesense, as the universal monster rule, allowing him to notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet as if he had blindsight. The warden must be at least 11th level before learning this secret. Thrive in Nature (Ex and Sp) Wardens are well known for their ability to survive in any climate.

Pale Theologian|General|Long ago there existed a group known as the Cult of Fathoms; this group of mages, clerics, and scholars sought to uncover the secrets of reality itself, the fundamental nature of divinity, and the building blocks that formed the universe. The Cult of Fathoms was divided into multiple sects, each focusing on a small aspect of reality that most interested them. One of these sects, known as the Deathkeepers, sought to unveil the secrets of death itself. These master necromancers uncovered ancient rituals that granted them lichdom, but even immortality did not satisfy them. They always felt there was more to uncover. Secrets left untapped. A small few of this sect eventually turned towards life magic; for what was death without life? Viewed as heretical or foolish by their fellow scholars, they carried on. Progress was slow and difficult, but they studies provided enough minor successes that the rest of their sect quickly joined their minds to the task. Their studies finally revealed to them the truth they sought, one they viewed as obvious and hindsight. Death and Life were not separate, but two sides of the same coin. Positive and negative energies were not opposites, but simply variations of the same base energy which they called the Pale. Using this newfound knowledge expanded their powers significantly. It revealed to them methods of necromantic healing lost the the ages, the ability to create undead who responded positively to positive energy, and the ability to infuse living flesh with negative energy without its usual deadly effects. The Deathkeepers expanded their organization in an attempt to publicize their findings and to bring the art of pale necromancy to the forefront. They argued that their art could revolutionize the world; healing made simpler and easier to perform without the reliance on the gods, undead infused with positive energy that did not mean the living harm, and other miracles their studies provided them. The gods of Death and Life did not view such blasphemies favorably, raising up legions of their follows to strike down the Deathkeepers, and eventually the Cult of Fathoms itself. After being thoroughly routed the surviving members Cult of Fathoms scattered to the winds, the knowledge of their organization and the secrets their discovered faded into antiquity. The knowledge of the Pale, however, was passed down by the few remaining ancestors of the Deathkeepers, eventually renaming themselves to the Palekeepers. This secretive sect of pale necromancers has persisted into modern times, seeking out others who they deem worthy of their knowledge or who seem naturally inclined to the mastery of both life and death magic. Most notable of this group are the pale theologians; users of both arcane and divine magics who have dedicated their lives to the study and utilization of the Pale, infusing and corrupting their minds and bodies with its power. These talented spellcasting roam the world in search of ancient secrets to bring back to their order, potential students, and to bring the energies and Death and Life to a balance. Pale theoligians often begin their journey as either necromancers of arcane or divine magic who seek greater understanding of their arts and are sought out by members of the order, but a rare few natural pale theologians discover the secrets of the pale on their own. Eventually learning to combine both arcane and divine magics, these skills mages are true masters of necromancy. Utilizing their magics they can support their allies, ward themselves from the negative effects of death, prolong their lives, animate the dead, heal the sick and dying, or bring death and plague to their foes. Alignment Any. Pale theologians are found from all walks of life, and the art of pale necromancy can be as easily used for good as it can be for ill. Hit Die d6 Starting Wealth 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. Class Skills The pale theologians class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks Per Level 2 + Int modifier. Class Features Weapon and Armor Proficiency A pale theologian is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. At 1st level, the pale theologian decides whether their magic is derived from an arcane source or a divine source. Once chosen, the pale theologians source of magic cannot be changed. Pale theologians who choose arcane as their source of magic suffer from arcane spell failure, and use Intelligence to determine their spellcasting abilities. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, an arcane pale theologian must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spells level. The saving throw DC against a pale theologians spell is 10 + the spells level + the pale theologians Intelligence modifier. An arcane pale theologian can cast pale theologian spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Pale theologians who choose the divine as their source of magic use Wisdom to determine their spellcasting abilities. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a divine pale theologian must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spells level. The saving throw DC against a pale theologians spell is 10 + the spells level + the pale theologians Wisdom modifier. Pale theologians combine the teachings of both arcane and divine magic to gain mastery over death, blending the two schools into a single form of magic. Pale theologians cast spells drawn from both the cleric and wizard spell lists, with a number of restrictions based on the source of their magic. They treat all of these spells as arcane or divine, based on their choice of magic (no matter whether the spell was originally a cleric or wizard spell). Arcane pale theologians treat all non-necromancy school wizard spells of 1st level or higher as 1 spell level higher. They treat all non-necromancy school cleric spells of 1st level or higher as 2 spell levels higher. For example; an arcane pale theologian would treat a 1st level evocation spell as 2nd level if it is a wizard spell, or 3rd level if it is a cleric spell. Divine pale theologians treat all non-necromancy school cleric spells of 1st level or higher as 1 spell level higher. They treat all non-necromancy school wizard spells of 1st level or higher as 2 spell levels higher. For example; a divine pale theologian would treat a 1st level evocation spell as 2nd level if itis a cleric spell, or 3rd level if it is a wizard spell. If a spell appears on both the cleric and wizard lists of differing spell levels, the pale theologian uses the lower of the two spell levels after adjusting their level above. A pale theologian can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Their base daily spell allotment is given on Table Pale Theologian under Spells per Day. In addition, they receive bonus spells per day if they have a high spellcasting ability score; Intelligence for arcane, Wisdom for divine. A pale theologian may know any number of spells, but the number they can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, they can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new pale theologian level, the number of spells they can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table Pale Theologian Spells Prepared. Unlike the number of spells they can cast per day, the number of spells a pale theologian can prepare each day is not affected by their spellcasting ability score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells a pale theologian can prepare. A pale theologian must choose and prepare their spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying their spellbook. While studying, the pale theologian decides what spells to prepare and refreshes their available spell slots for the day. Like a sorcerer, the pale theologian can choose to apply any metamagic feats they know to a prepared spell as they cast it, with the same increase in casting time. However,they may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats they know and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. They cannot combine these optionsa spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting. Pale theologians combine the study of divine and arcane magics to fuel their powers, containing their findings and unique methods of casting spells in a specially prepared tome called a spellbook. A pale theologian must study their spellbook each day to prepare their spells. They cant prepare any spell not recorded in their spellbook, except for read magic (which all pale theologians can prepare from memory). A pale theologian begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard and cleric spells plus three 1st-level spells of their choice. The pale theological also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to their spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for arcane, Wisdom for divine) to add to the spellbook. At each new pale theologian level, they gain two new spells of any spell level or levels that they can cast (based on their new pale theologian level) for their spellbook. A pale theologian can also add additional spells to their spellbook.They can add cleric and wizard spells found as scrolls to their spellbook, and add spells found in another pale theologians or wizards spell book to their own. This follows the same rules as a wizard copying spells to their spellbook. A pale theologian can also add cleric spells to their spellbook through the aid of another cleric. A divine caster can preach the working of a cleric spell to the pale theologian while they copy the teaching in to their spellbook. This process is similar to them copying a spell from another casters spellbook to their own, but it requires a divine spellcaster with the desired spell prepared to be present for the entire duration, and then for them to expend the spell at the end of the required time. This process requires the same expense in gold pieces as copying a spell from a wizard spellbook. Hiring a divine spellcaster to teach you a spell usually costs the amount to purchase the spell to be cast for you, often with an additional cost based on the time required. Pale theologians can also research their spells independently, as a wizard. When they do so, the spell counts as an arcane spell on the wizard spell list. Pale theologians can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table Pale Theologian Spells Prepared. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with their other spells, these spells are not expended when cast. Pale theologians treat the following spells as necromancy spells of the listed level, rather than their normal school and level, when determining their spell list stabilize (0 level), cure light wounds (1st level), remove sickness (1st level), cure moderate wounds (2nd level), lesser restoration (2nd level), remove paralysis (2nd level), cure serious wounds (3rd level), remove blindness/deafness (3rd level), remove curse (3rd level), remove disease (3rd level), symbol of healing (3rd level), cure critical wounds (4th level), restoration (4th level), mass cure light wounds (5th level), pillar of life (5th level), raise dead (5th level), mass cure light wounds (6th level), heal (6th level), greater restoration (7th level), mass cure serious wounds (7th level), resurrection (7th level), mass cure critical wounds (8th level), mass heal (9th level), true resurrection (9th level). Spells affected by this ability retain any descriptors they possess, and their effects do not change. For example, a cure light wounds cast by a pale theologian would be treated as a 1st level necromancy spell with the healing descriptor, and it would still heal living creatures and harm undead creatures. Pale theologians can convert their magical power directly into necromantic power, allowing them to cast a number of spells spontaneously using their spell slots. Whenever the pale theologian rests and regains their spell slots, they can choose to either harness the power of healing magics, or harming magics. Until the next time they regain their spell slots, they can spontaneously cast a number of spells based on their choice. If these spells require an expensive material component, the pale theologian is required to provide it as normal for casting the spell. If they chose healing magics, they can spend any of their spell slots to cast one of the following spells of equal to or lower level than the spent spell slot all cure spells (a cure spell is any spell with cure in its name), lesser restoration, restoration, remove disease, neutralize poison, remove curse, greater restoration, heal, mass heal. If they chose harming magics, they can spend any of their spell slots to cast a one of the following spells of equal to or lower level than the spent spell slot all inflict spells (an inflict spell is any spell with inflict in its name), contagion, greater contagion, poison, bestow curse, enervation, major curse, harm, mass harm. The pale theologian can cast the spells they selected from memory and can prepare them using their normal allotment of spells prepared without the need of their spellbook. A pale theologian has learned to tap into a reservoir of power which they can pull from to fuel the powers of the pale. This pool contains a number of points per day equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum 1). At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the pale theologian gains an additional 1 theology point. Theology points can be spent to fuel any of the pale theologians class features that require their expenditure. At 1st level, the pale theologian learns to imbue their pale magics within a corpse to raise it as an undead creature, or within a living or undead creature to bolster their attunement to the pale and to restore their wounds. They choose one of the following abilities at 1st level. Once this ability has been chosen, it cannot be changed The effects of this ability persist for 1 minute per class level, though the pale theologian can end the effect early by touching the target again as a swift action. Creatures who are neither living nor undead (such as constructs) cannot be affected by this ability. At 3rd level, the effects of this ability persist for 10 minutes per class level. At 5th level, this ability may be used on (and removed from) creatures within Close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 class levels), rather than only touch range, and the pale theologian may apply this ability as a move action. At 7th level, the effects of this ability persist for 1 hour per class level. At 9th level, the range of this ability increases to Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per class level). At 11th level, the effects of this ability persist for 1 day per 5 class levels, and they may apply this ability as a swift action. Additionally, the pale theologian can rapidly imbue a creature with pale energies to restore their wounded form. The pale theologian can touch a living or undead creature as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to immediately restore 1d6+ their Charisma modifier points of damage to the touched creature. This healing increases by an additional 1d6 at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter. At 1st level, the pale theologian can touch a single corpse as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to animate it as lesser animate dead, using their class level as their caster level. When using this ability, the pale theologian can choose to cast it without the need of expensive material components, but when they do so the created undead has a number of restrictions the undeads duration is reduced to 1 minute per class level and the pale theologian can only have a single undead creature created using this ability active at a time. When the duration of this ability expires, or the pale theologian created a second undead using this ability, the magic leaves the corpse, halting its animation. This does not destroy the corpse, allowing it to be animated again. When doing so, it has the same amount of hit points as when the effects of this ability ended. This created undead still counts against the pool of undead the pale theologian can control using animate dead. At 3rd level, undead created without material components now have a duration of 10 minutes per class level. At 5th level, this ability functions as animate dead. At 7th level, undead created without material components now have a duration of 1 hour per class level. At 9th level, the pale theologian can now control two undead created without material components at a time. At 11th level, undead created without material components now have a duration of 2 hours per class level. At 1st level, the pale theologian can touch a corpse as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to preserve it for 24 hours, extending the time limit on raising it from the dead. During these 24 hours the corpse does not rot, and does not smell. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a secret of the pale reveals itself to the pale theologian, allowing them to obtain powers and abilities unheard of to those who only dabble in the powers of life or death. See Secrets of the Pale Constant exposure to the pale arts of life and death permanently mars the body of the pale theologian, corrupting it into a state of not quite life and not quite undeath. At 3rd level, the pale theologian gains their first corruption from the list below. They gain additional pale corruptions at their stated level. If a corruption requires a saving throw, it has a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 their pale theologian level + their Charisma modifier. See Pale Corruption Replacements As a swift action, the pale theologian can spend 1 theology point to suppress the energy of life or death within them for 1 hour, allowing them to only be treated as a living creature(healed fully by positive energy, damaged by negative) or only treated as an undead creature (healed fully by negative energy, damaged by positive) for effects that affect living or undead creatures. They can choose to suppress or activate this effect as a free action, but the duration continues to expire while it is suppressed. Once per turn as a free action while this ability is active they can choose to change whether they are suppressing life energy or death energy. At 7th level, the pale theologians connection to the pale further corrupts their body, causing their eyes to glow with a baleful radiance, alerting others to their nature and granting them sight much like an undead creature. The pale theologian gains Darkvision 60 feet, or 120 feet if they already possessed natural Darkvision. This Darkvision is an extraordinary effect. As a standard action they can focus their vision, allowing them to see pale energies. Until the end of their next turn, the pale theologian can determine whether creatures and corpses they can see within Close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 pale theologian levels) of them are alive, undead, or neither alive nor undead within Close range of them. They can also detect the general health of living and undead creatures while using this ability, determining whether they are wounded (see below) and if they are affected by a disease or poison. When the pale theologian activates this ability, they may spend 1 theology point to extend its duration to 1 minute. At the end of this duration, they can spend another theology point to extend its duration another minute. If a creatures true nature is being obscured by an illusion or transmutation effect, the pale theologian gains a free Will save or Perception check against the illusion or disguise the first time they perceive it with this ability. This ability is a supernatural effect. When detecting the health of living or undead creatures the pale theologian determines the creatures general condition as determined below. At 11th level, the energy that corrupts the pale theologian causes them to project an unnatural presence that unnerves most natural creatures. Animals, Magical Beasts, and Plant creatures have their starting attitude towards the pale theologian reduced by 1 step. As a standard action, the pale theologian can empower their unnerving presence, causing the above creatures to not approach within Close range of them until the end of the pale theologians next turn. Affected creatures within Close range of them when they activate this ability, or if they begin the turn in its area, must make a Will saving throw or attempt to flee the area on their next turn. On a success, they are immune to this ability until the beginning of their next turn. Above creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can attempt to enter the area by making a Will saving throw when they attempt to enter it. On a success, they become immune to the effects of this ability until the beginning of their next turn. On a failure, they cannot enter the area and cannot try to do so again until the beginning of their next turn, but can otherwise continue movement. This ability is a mind-affecting fear effect. Additionally, mindless undead always have a starting attitude of Indifferent to the pale theologian, and will only attack if provoked or ordered to by a spellcaster that controls them. Intelligent undead have their starting attitude increased to indifferent if their attitude would normally start at hostile or unfriendly. Intelligent undead are usually curious of the pale theologian, rather than outright hostile, but some intelligent undead may still attack the pale theologian without cause. The pale theologian also becomes immune to disease, poison, and to effects that require a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or are harmless. At 19th level, the pale theologians study of the forces of life and death combined with the pale energies infusing their body has fundamentally altered their mind, their thoughts realigning to perfectly understand the hidden obscurities of death and life. They become immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), fear effects, sleep effects, and stunning. At 20th level, the pale theologian advances their body beyond death itself. Their Constitution score becomes , and they gain a +4 bonus to their Charisma score. The pale theologian uses their Charisma to determine their hit points, Fortitude saving throws, and abilities that would normally be based off of their Constitution. The pale theologian ceases to age. If they are slain and their body is not destroyed, they are immediately reanimated as a zombie lord at full hit points. After 1 week passes they automatically return to life at full hit points. If they are slain before this week passes, this ability cannot save them again. At 5th level, the pale theologian has learned rites that grant them unique methods of defending themselves against undead creatures and the effects of life and death magic. The pale theologian gains a +1 competence bonus on AC and CMD against undead, on saving throws against the extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of undead creatures, and on saving throws against death effects, and effects that deal with positive or negative energy. These bonuses increase by an additional +1 at 10th, 15th, and 20th level. At 9th level, the pale theologian can bestow special funerary rites to a slain creature that prevents them from being raised from the dead or reanimated as an undead creature. Performing these rites requires the slain creatures corpse to be within their reach for 1 minute, and an expenditure of 1 point from their theology pool. When performed, anyone who attempts to raise the creature from the dead, or attempts to make an undead from the creatures corpse, must make a caster level check with a DC of 11 + the pale theologians class level. If they fail this check their attempt fails, and they cannot attempt to raise or reanimate the corpse again for 24 hours. If this ability is used against the corpse of an undead creature who cannot be destroyed by conventional means (such as a bloody skeleton) with a number of hit dice equal to or lower than the pale theologians class level, that undead is destroyed permanently. This ability can only be used in this way against undead whose physical bodies restore themselves, and cannot be used against creatures like a ghost or a lich. Particularly powerful creatures may be immune or resistant to this function of the ability, at the GMs discretion. At 15th level, the pale theologian can bestow special restorative rites to a corpse to imbue it with life and unlife in equal measure, temporarily reanimating it. Performing these rites requires the slain creatures corpse to be within their reach for 1 minute, and an expenditure of at least 3 points from their theology pool. When performed, the creature returns to life for 24 hours at 1 hit point. For every 3 additional theology points they spend as part of this rite, the duration is extended by an additional 24 hours. At any time during this time, the pale theologian may perform these rites on that creature again to extend the duration further. At 19th level, the pale theologians studies have revealed to them methods of breaking or subverting the command a spellcaster holds over an undead creature. Whenever the pale theologian successfully identifies an undead creature using Knowledge (religion), they immediately learn whether the undead is being controlled by magic or not. As a standard action they can spend one point from their theology pool to attempt to subvert or break the control over an undead within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per pale theologian level), rolling 1d20 and adding their class level + 5 against a DC equal to 11 + the controllers caster level. If they succeeds and the target is a mindless undead, they can either choose to break the spellcasters control (causing the undead to become free-willed) or take control of the undead (adding it to the pool of undead they control using animate dead or Command Undead if they possess the feat). If they succeed and the target is an intelligent undead, they can only choose to break the magic controlling it unless they possess the Command Undead feat, in which case they can gain command using that feat as part of this ability. The path of pale theology is sometimes guided by intense loss and a desire to regain, rather than control over natural forces. A pale theologian must select the imbue with unlife ability with their pale imbuement to select this alternate class feature. Alternatively, if they later gain the imbue with unlife ability using the Expanded Imbuement secret, they can choose to gain this alternate class feature and apply it to that ability. Once they make this choice, it cannot be changed. The bonded in death may only have a single undead created using their imbue with unlife ability at a time. This undead creature is inhabited by the soul of a loved one lost to the bonded in death, known as their dearly departed. If they create a second undead using imbue with unlife while they already have an undead created, they must choose which of the two to destroy. The dearly departed is fiercely loyal to the bonded in death and possesses intelligence which they use to act with the reanimated corpses body. At 1st level, assign one of each of the following scores to the dearly departeds Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 16, 14, 12. Each score can only be assigned to one ability. Rather than using the mental ability scores of the mindless undead, the undead created by your imbue with unlife uses the dearly departeds mental ability scores. The dearly departed grants the undead creature it possesses skill ranks and feats based on the bonded in deaths level, granting one feat at 1st level and every 2 class levels thereafter, and grants 2 + the dearly departeds Intelligence modifier skill ranks for each level of the bonded in death, with a maximum number of ranks in any one skill equal to the bonded in deaths level. The dearly departed treats every skill as a class skill. The dearly departed also gains an increase to their channel resistance equal to their Charisma modifier. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, one of the dearly departeds mental ability scores is increased by 1 point. The dearly departed shares the languages of the bonded in death and can speak even if it would have been unable to in life. These feats and skill ranks are chosen each time the bonded in death gains a class level. This modifies the pale theologians pale imbuement class feature. Special This alternate class feature can be combined with the spectral reanimator alternate class feature, despite them both modifying the same class feature. When doing so, the bonded in deaths dearly departed is animated as a specter without the need of a corpse, has a number of hit dice equal to the dearly departeds class level, and at 1st level the following ability scores are assigned to the dearly departeds Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 16, 16, 14, 12. Each score can only be assigned to one ability. The dearly departeds Dexterity gains a +2 bonus, as normal for a specter, but their other mental ability scores are not modified or replaced. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonded in death increases one of these ability scores by 1. If the bonded in deaths spectral dearly departed is destroyed, the next time they attempt to create them using their imbue with death ability it costs an additional 2 theology points, which returns the dearly departed to full hit points. This otherwise follows all other rules and restrictions of both alternate class features. The bonded in death cannot select the Legion of the Dead secret, instead they gain access to the following secrets of the pale Warding Bond (Su) The bonded in deaths spiritual bond with their dearly departed is so strong that it wards them from harm while they are in each others presence. While the bonded in death and their dearly departed are within 30 feet of each other they both gain a +2 profane bonus to their AC and their Will saves, and whenever one of them takes damage the other can choose to take half that damage, rounded up (after applying damage reduction, resistances, or the like). This shared damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way and bypasses any immunities either might possess. Some pale theologians specialize in calling upon the lingering remnants of the soul that cling to the bodies of the dead rather than animating the corpses directly. The pale theologian must select the imbue with unlife ability with their pale imbuement class feature to select this alternate class feature. If they later gain the imbue with unlife ability using the Expanded Imbuement secret, they can choose to gain this alternate class feature and apply it to that ability. Once they make this choice, it cannot be changed. The spectral reanimators imbue with unlife functions as the extract specter spell rather than lesser animate dead. When the duration of this specter expires, it can be extracted from the same corpse again following all the same restrictions as animating an undead create with imbue with unlife. At 5th level, this ability instead functions as greater extract specter, rather than animate dead. This modifies the pale theologians pale imbuement class feature. Special If a pale theologian with a spherecasting archetype selects this alternate class feature, this ability instead functions as the Animate Specter talent. The spectral reanimator cannot select the Legion of the Dead secret, instead they gain access to the following secrets of the pale Awakened Extraction (Su) When the spectral reanimator creates a permanent specter using their imbue with unlife ability they can choose to spend an extra 2 theology points and an additional 25gp worth of onyx per Hit Die of the specter as part of its creation to imbue it with intellect, as extract awakened specter. Special If a pale theologian with a spherecasting archetype selects this secret, it instead functions as the Awaken Specter advanced talent. They must still pay the material components associated with this ability.

Secrets of the Pale|General|The pale theologian has learned to replace one of their arms with an undead limb, granting them a touch attack that devastates their foes with pale energies. The pale theologian gains a melee touch attack that deals damage equal to 1d6 damage + their Charisma modifier. This damage causes wounds and lesions to appear across the struck targets flesh, dealing untyped physical damage. This damage bypasses most resistances and immunities, but can be reduced by DR/ and hardness. The pale theologian uses this touch attack as if it were a light melee weapon wielded by the replaced arm for the purposes of attacks, and making attacks using it requires their hand to be free. This touch attack counts as a weapon in the close fighter weapon group, and can be enhanced by feats and abilities that can be used to enhance melee weapons, such as Weapon Focus (arm of undeath). This touch attack can also be enhanced by magic as if it were a natural weapon or an unarmed strike, such as by using magic handwraps or an amulet of mighty fists. This secret can be selected multiple times, once for each of the pale theologians arms. While the pale theologian is infected by a disease, they canspend 1 theology point as a standard action to cause their flesh to spread a foul disease-ridden miasma. This miasma is an aura with a radius of 15 feet that spreads around corners and through small gaps. The pale theologian chooses a single disease they are infected with when they activate this ability and imbues their miasma with that disease. It is treated as an inhaled disease, and any creature within their miasma risks being exposed to it if they breathe within the miasmas area. This miasma persists for 1 minute. At pale theologian level 5, and every 5 levels thereafter, the radius of their miasma increases by 5 feet. If the pale theologian uses this ability while it is already active, the first miasma immediately ends. The pale theologian can always choose to end this ability early as a standard action. This is a supernatural effect. This secret of the pale can be selected multiple times; when selected twice, the pale theologian can have their miasma persist for 10 minutes. When selected a third time, the miasma persists until they choose to end it early as a standard action, or if they activate the ability again. The pale theologian has learned to lace their words with lingering energies that allow them to influence the will of uncontrolled mindless undead. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person, save that the pale theologian rolls 1d20 and adds their pale theologian level and their Charisma modifier to determine the results of this check. Unlike a normal Diplomacy check, the Diplomacy DC of this check is equal to 10 + the mindless undeads Hit Dice to increase their attitude to Friendly, or 20 + the mindless undeads Hit Dice to increase their attitude to Helpful. Should the pale theologian fail, they may not attempt to sway that specific undead for 24 hours. This ability has no effect on mindless undead that are under a creatures control. To use this ability, the pale theologian must spend 1 minute speaking within 30 feet of the undead creature. The undead must be able to perceive the pale theologian, and must not be able to see any other creatures it is Hostile or Unfriendly towards. A mindless undead whose attitude is improved to Friendly will perform actions the pale theologian directs that align within its nature (such as moving to a specific location, defending a locale, or attacking creatures it is naturally hostile towards). The undead generally wont stray too far from the location it was found. A mindless undead whose attitude is improved to Helpful will perform tasks as the pale theologian directs, even if they would go against their nature, much like an undead creature under their command. Attitude shifts caused by this ability last for 1 hour per 5 pale theologian levels. Further attempts against a specific undead creature after the first each day have their DC increased by +5 for each additional attempt. If the pale theologian or their allies attack the undead, its attitude shifts as normal. The pale theologian can also use this ability to influence an undead creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but they take a -4 penalty on the check. At the GMs discretion, repeated successful uses over many days may allow the pale theologian to permanently affect the starting attitude of an undead creature. The pale theologian uncovers secrets of the divine nature ofthe pale, allowing them to channel its energies. The pale theologian chooses either positive or negative energy when they gain this ability, and can channel the chosen energy, as the cleric class feature, a total number of times per day equal to 3 + their Charisma modifier. The pale theologian does not need a holy or unholy symbol to use this ability. The pale theologian uses their class level in place of their cleric level when determining the saving throw DC of their channeled energy. When the pale theologian channels energy, they can spend 1 theology point to target both living and undead creatures with their channeled energy. This secret can be selected a second time, allowing them to channel the energy type they didnt select. Each time they use this ability, they choose whether they are channeling positive or negative energy. When channeling energy, they can spend 2 theology points to channel both positive and negative energy simultaneously. When doing so, they can choose whether to affect living or undead creatures individually for each energy type. The pale theologians aptitude towards raising the dead has granted them knowledge of rites that can improve their durability. When the pale theologian creates an undead using their imbue with unlife ability, they can spend 1 additional theology point to grant the created undead an additional 2 Hit Points per hit die, a +1 bonus to their CMD, and a +1 increase to their existing natural armor. The granted bonus to their CMD and the increase to their natural armor increases by an additional +1 at levels 6, 10, 14, and 18. The pale theologian chooses an additional ability from the pale imbuement class feature; they gain the ability to use that ability in addition to their initial choice. The pale theologian has learned to infuse their limbs withtheir spiritual essence, allowing them to grasp objects outside their normal reach. The pale theologian can grab, pickup, and interact with unattended objects within their natural reach plus 10 feet. This does not extend their reach with melee weapons, but does allow them to deliver melee touch attacks using this extended reach. This extended reach increases by an additional 5 feet at 6th, 12th, and 18th level. The pale theologian has unearthed ancient and hidden secrets regarding death and undead creatures. They gain a +2 bonus to Heal checks, Knowledge checks regarding funerary rites, religious ceremonies about death, the realms where souls travel to after a living creature dies, and for identifying undead creatures, as well as a +2 bonus to Profession checks involving religious work and the dead. These bonuses increase by an additional +1 at 4th level, and every 2 levels thereafter. Special If you are using the optional rules for the Handle Undead skill, this secret of the pale applies to this skill as well. The pale theologian has learned to animate lesser corpses into a legion under their command using their imbue with unlife ability. Undead the pale theologian can control in this way have a limit to the number of Hit Dice they may possess, and the number of undead they can animate in this way is determined by adding together their class level and their Charisma modifier, and then consulting Table Legion of the Dead. Reanimating these undead requires corpses and costs theology points as normal, and are animated as the imbue with unlife ability. Only normal skeletons and zombies can be animated, not variant or improved undead. These undead do not require expensive material components to create, and do not count against the limit of undead they can control with their imbue with unlife ability or their animate dead spell. These undead have no maximum duration. This secret can be selected multiple times, further empowering the pale theologians legion. They can create and control variant undead using this ability . Any undead they raise into their service with this rite that isnt a normal skeleton or zombie counts an undead of 50% more hit dice (rounded up), when determining its effect Hit Dice for this ability. Thus, the pale theologian can create variant undead with a maximum of 4 Hit Dice using this ability. Additionally, they treat their pale theologian level as 6 higher for the purposes of this ability for each time it is selected after the first. The pale theologian has uncovered commandments that will sway the undead to their will. As a standard action, the pale theologian may spend 2 theology points to attempt to charm a single undead creature, as command undead, for 24 hours. The pale theologian has attained a level of control beyond even the most skilled of necromancers. The pale theologian adds their pale theologian level to the number of Hit Dice of undead they may control using animate dead. This secret can be selected a second time, allowing them to add twice their pale theologian level instead. The pale theologian has learned to channel their deathly powers into a potent contagion. The pale theologian gains the ability to cast contagion as a spell-like ability by spending 1 theology point as a standard action. The pale theologian uses their class level as their caster level with this ability, and their Charisma when determining its saving throw DC. When the pale theologian reaches 9th level, they may cast greater contagion by spending 3 theology points instead. These are supernatural effects. The pale theologians flesh has become hardened and corpselike, granting them a natural armor bonus of +2. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The pale theologian has learned to imbue their body with pale energies, allowing them to survive wounds that would kill most other users of magic. The pale theologian gains an additional +2 hit points per pale theologian level. This secret can be selected twice, its effects stack. The pale theologian has learned to infuse their own organs with pale energies, granting them an incredible resistance to precision strikes. When they are hit by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and instead rolled normally. This secret can be selected an additional three times. Each additional selection increases the chance to negate a critical hit or sneak atiack by 25% (to a max of 100% when selected four times). This secret does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits or sneak attacks, such as the fortification armor property. The pale theologians studies have unveiled some of the secrets of lichdom to them, allowing them to attune their soul to a phylactery. When the pale theologian dies or is destroyed, their soul returns to this phylactery and begins to rebuild their body over three weeks. If their body is destroyed during this process, it begins anew. After this time passes the pale theologian awakens fully healed, albeit with none of the gear that was left on their body when they died. If more than 1 day has passed and the pale theologians phylactery is intact, they cannot be raised from the dead through other means. At any point while their body is being rebuilt the pale theologian can choose to accelerate the process with devastating effects on the resulting body. They may choose to reduce the time it takes their body to rebuild by up to three weeks (reduced in 1 week increments). If they have less than 1 week remaining, they can reduce the duration to 24 hours. This still counts as reducing the duration by 1 week. For each week they reduce the time by, their resulting body gains 1 permanent negative level, even if they are normally immune to negative levels. These negative levels do not kill or destroy the pale theologian, instead, if these negative levels would reduce them to 0 Hit Dice they take 4 points of Charisma drain (even if they are immune to ability drain). The pale theologian immediately knows if their phylactery has been destroyed. If their phylactery is destroyed, they can create a new phylactery, requiring 15 days, and an expenditure of 500 gp per character level. The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containingstripsofparchmentonwhichmagicalphraseshave been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items. This secret can be selected multiple times. If selected a second time, the time it takes for their body to rebuild is reduced to 2 weeks. If selected a third time, the time is reduced to 1 week. If selected a fourth time, the time is reduced to 24 hours. The pale theologian has learned to further adapt themselves to the magics of death. They add half their class level to their saving throws against death effects, spells of the necromancy school, and any ability that deals negative energy damage. They take no penalty from negative levels gained via energy drain or death effects, though they can still be killed if they accrue more negative levels than they have Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels they take are removed without the need for an additional saving throw. The pale theologian has developed a technique to bolster a creature with both life and death magics, forestalling the harmful effects of bodily harm upon them. The pale theologian can touch a creature as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to forestall the targets bodily demise. For the next hour, the creature does not suffer the negative effects of any ability damage, ability drain, ability penalties, or negative levels imposed by bleed effects, curses, death effects, diseases, or poisons they are suffering from, and they automatically stabilize if reduced to -1 or fewer hit points. If they are affected by a bleed effect, they are automatically cured of the effect at the end of their turn. This ability does not grant immunity to these effects; they may still gain these conditions, though they do not suffer any penalties unless their ability damage or drain would reduce an ability score to 0 or they would accrue a number of negative levels equal to their Hit Dice, in which case they suffer the normal penalties (death, paralysis, madness, unconsciousness, etc). At 4th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the duration of this ability increases by 1 hour. The pale theologian learns special rites to manipulate corpses using the magics of the pale, granting them the following abilities The pale theologian can touch a single corpse as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to cause it to immediately decay. The flesh of the corpse immediately bubbles away into a viscous rot, leaving the creature's skeleton behind. For the purposes of raise dead, a decayed corpse is treated as if twice the amount of time has passed when determining if it can be raised. The pale theologian can touch a skeletal corpse as a standard action and spend 1 theology point to restore its flesh, allowing it to be reanimated as a zombie or other type of undead that requires a fleshy corpse. This created flesh does not resemble the creatures flesh in life, is inedible, and cannot be used as a component for spells or abilities that require flesh. This flesh begins to rapidly decay upon its creation, rottng away to nothing after 24 hours unless it is preserved using magic or the corpse is animated as an undead creature. The pale theologian can touch the corpse of a destroyed undead as a standard action and spend 1 theology point and 25gp worth of onyx per Hit Die of the undead to restore it to an intact state, allowing it to be animated once again using animate dead or similar effects. When an undead is reanimated using a restored corpse, it is only reanimated with 1 hit point (it still has its normal maximum hit points). The pale theologian can perform special rites that restore the flesh and spirits of themselves and their allies. Performing these rites takes 1 minute and an expenditure of at least 2 theology points. After these rites are performed, the pale theologian and each of their living or undead allies within 20 feet of them regain 1d6 hit points per pale theologian level. For every 2 additional theology points spent, they regain these hit points an additional time. The pale theologians studies of the pale arts have revealed to them numerous secrets involving undead creatures, including their particular weaknesses or traits. They gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls, CMB, and skill checks against undead creatures. These bonuses increase by an additional 1 at levels 6, 10, 14 and 18. If they successfully identify an undead creature using Knowledge (Religion), or using another skill if they have the ability to do so, these bonuses are increased by 50% (rounded up) against that target for 24 hours. As a swift action, the pale theologian can inform an ally who can hear them (or if they can perceive the pale theologian with another method of verbal communication, such as telepathy) with an intelligence score of 3 or greater of information that can assist them against an undead creature of the pale theologians choice within Medium range, granting the ally the bonuses of this ability against that specific undead creature until the beginning of the pale theologians next turn. This secret can be selected a second time, causing this ability to grant its bonus to weapon damage rolls and opposed ability checks against undead, and also grants the pale theologian a dodge bonus to AC against undead. These bonuses are insight bonuses, and are equal to the other bonuses granted by this secretofthepale(andthusareincreasedby50%againstundead they have identified). When the pale theologian grants an ally the bonuses of their lay to rest, they gain these bonuses as well. The pale theologian has infused themselves with spectral energy, causing their muscles to atrophy away while infusing their body with ghostly strength. The pale theologians Strength score becomes . They use their Charisma to determine their carrying capacity and use their Charisma modifier in place of their Strength when making Strength checks and when determining their CMB and CMD. Since the pale theologian has no Strength score, they use their Charisma when making melee attacks. They do not add their Charisma modifier to their damage rolls when doing so. The pale theologians study of death and life magic has granted them unique insights into the working of magic itself, allowing them to infuse a wider array of spells with their specialized casting methodologies. The pale theologian selects a number of cleric or wizard spells equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum 1); they learn these spells and can prepare them without the need of their spellbook, and treat them as their cleric or wizard spell level when treating them as pale theologian spells, rather than their modified level. The pale theologian can only prepare and cast these spells if they have spell slots of the appropriate level to do so, but may choose to learn spells they cannot yet cast if they wish. If the pale theologian later gains a permanent increase to their Charisma modifier, they may select additional spells. If they lose this permanent increase they lose the ability to cast those spells, and if they regain the increase they gain the ability to cast the originally chosen spells again. The pale theologian may also treat these spells as necromancy-school spells for the purposes of their feats and abilities that modify or empower necromancy spells. They cannot combine these abilities with abilities that would affect the spells base school. The spell is still treated as its base school for all other purposes. The pale theologian has gained greater understanding and control over their undead minions, allowing them to sense their presence and share their senses. The pale theologian always knows the location of undead under their control relative to them. As a standard action by spending 1 theology point, the pale theologian can attune their senses to a single one of their undead under their control for 10 minutes. The pale theologian sees and hears through that undead creature, but their own body is blinded and deafened. They can suppress or reactivate this ability during its active duration as a standard action. The pale theologian and their controlled undead creature must be on the same plane of existence to use this ability. The pale theologian's studies have allowed them the knowledge to pull the long-broken remains of the dead from fertile soil. The pale theologian can create a single 1 Hit Die skeleton using their imbue with unlife ability by drawing the fertility from a 10-foot cube of fertile soil within Long range of them, rather than using a creatures corpse. The pale theologian can increase the hit dice of this skeleton by draining additional 10-foot cubes of fertile soil, to a maximum Hit Dice equal to their class level. If they do so, the created skeleton gains a +1 bonus to its base Strength or Dexterity per 4 hit Dice it possesses, chosen at the time of its creation. Soil drawn from using this secret is diminished and cannot be drawn from again for one year. Additionally, it causes all plants that grow within it to only grow half as fast, and produce half as much produce for the next year. The skeleton created using this secret has base stats depending on the form the pale theologian chooses it to take. These base stats include the bonus to Dexterity granted by the skeleton template.

Spell Twists (Elementer)|General|The following lists all available spell twists to an elementer. Elementers can select any spell twist from this list at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter. Element The spell twists element, which can be air, earth, fire, or water, or any. The elementer must sacrifice a prepared elemental spell of the matching element to use the spell twist. In the case of an any spell twist, she can use any elemental spell, and the spell twists effect changes depending on the element used. Effect The resulting effect of the spell twist. The effects listed here are for sacrificing a 1st level spell. Boost If the elementer sacrifices an elemental spell of a higher level than 1st, the spell twist gains more power as described in this section. Element Fire Effect You conjure scorching ash to blind your foes. A single creature within 30 feet of you must make a Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Boost For every spell level above 1st, you can target an additional creature. All targets must be within range. Element Earth Effect The earth rises at your command. This functions similar to a wall of stone, except it has a range of 30 feet, and the stone is only 1 inch thick and occupies a single 5-foot square. You cannot double the walls area by halving its thickness, as you normally could with wall of stone. The wall must be on solid ground or near a similar earthen surface (like a cavern wall). Boost For every spell above 1st, you can create an additional two 5-foot squares of stone and the thickness of the stone increases by 1 inch (to a maximum depth of six inches). The wall must be contiguous. Element Any Effect You create a destructive ray of planar force. Make a ranged touch attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, you deal 1d8 damage per caster level (max 3d8) of a type based on the element of spell used acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the max damage increases by 3d8 and the range increases by 10 feet. Element Fire Effect You set the world ablaze. You create a single 10-foot cube of fire, which must be created adjacent to your space. Creatures in the blaze take 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in the flames; a Reflex save halves the damage. The flames last a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 1d6 and you can create an additional 10-foot cube of flames. The cubes must all be adjacent to one another (with one needing to be adjacent to you). Element Water Effect A powerful current backs your movement. As a swift action, you gain a swim speed of 40 feet, a +8 bonus on Swim checks, and can breath underwater. If you already have a swim speed, you increase it by 20 feet, instead. This swim speed lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the swim speed (or bonus to a swim speed) increases by 10 feet, the Swim bonus by +1, and the duration by 1 round. If the slot used is at least 3rd level, you suffer no penalties for attacking while underwater. If the slot used is at least 6th, you are unaffected by hazards from being deep underwater, such as pressure damage. Element Water Effect A surge of ocean water fills a creatures lungs. A single creature within 30 feet of you takes 2d6 nonlethal damage and is staggered for 1 round. A Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering effect. A creature that can breathe underwater or doesnt need to breathe at all is unaffected by this spell twist, as are creatures with no discernible anatomy to affect (such as oozes or an air elemental). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 2d6. For every two spell levels above 1st, you can target an additional creature. All targets must be within 30 feet of you. Element Any Boost For every spell level above 1st, you can target an additional willing creature and the effect lasts an additional round. For every three spell levels above 1st, the damage bonus increases by 1d6. Element Fire Effect You quickly vanish and reappear a short distance away, your image flickering like fire. You teleport up to 20 feet away. Creatures and combustible objects within 5 feet of your destination take 2d6 fire damage. A Reflex save halves the damage taken. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the maximum distance you can teleport increases by 20 feet, and the damage increases by 2d6. Element Water Effect A sudden wave crashes in front of you. The water fills a 15-foot cone directly in front of you with torrential water. Non-magical fires in the area are extinguished immediately. Medium-sized (or smaller) creatures and objects in the area are pushed back make a separate bull-rush attempt against each. You may substitute your elementer level in place of your base attack bonus and your Intelligence in place of your Strength bonus for these bull rush attempts, and the attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Both the bull rush and the pushing of the objects cant exceed 5 feet beyond the cones end. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the amount of water increases significantly. The range of the cone increases by 5 feet, and you gain an additional +1 bonus to your bull rush attempts. For every two spell levels above 1st, the maximum size of creatures and objects you can push increases by one size category. Element Water Effect You conjure a powerful chill to encase a target. A single creature or object within 30 feet of you takes 2d6 cold damage; an affected creature is entangled for 1d4 rounds. A Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the entangling effect. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 2d6. For every two spell levels above 1st, you can target an additional creature or object. All targets must be within 30 feet of you. Element Earth Effect A gout of acidic earth sprays upon a target within 30 feet. The target takes 2d6 acid damage; a creature struck is also sickened for 1 round. A Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickening effect. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 2d6. For every two spell levels above 1st, you can target an additional creature or object. All targets must be within 30 feet of you. Element Air Effect Bellowing winds rush forth from you. The winds fill a 10-foot radius burst around you, acting as a strong wind (about 25 mph) directly away from you for 1 round. This follows all of the normal rules for strong winds, including dispersing harmful gases, mists, and vapors, penalizing ranged attacks, pushing creatures, and so on. Boost For every spell level above 1st, you can increase the radius of the burst by 10 feet. For every two spell levels above 1st, the strength of the winds increases by one category. If you use a 9th level spell to create tornado-strength winds, creatures are still pushed away rather than pulled inwards toward you. Element Fire Effect A burst of sweltering heat emits from your hand in a 20-foot cone. Creatures in this area take 2d6 nonlethal fire damage and are fatigued. A Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the fatigue effect. This cannot cause a fatigued creature to become exhausted. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the nonlethal damage increases by 2d6. For every two slots above 1st, the range of the cone increases by 5 feet. Element Any Effect Elemental energies disrupt your opponents casting. As an immediate action, you counter a spell that appears in the same elemental category as the spell you used, or has one of the following descriptors based on the element of spell used air (air, electricity, or sonic), earth (acid, earth), fire (fire, light), or water (cold, water). The countered spell must be 1st level or lower. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the level of spell you can counter increases by 1. Element Fire Effect You set the target alight. A target creature or object within 30 feet of you takes 2d6 fire damage and is set on fire, taking 1d6 fire damage each round thereafter. A Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates the burning effect. A creature or object set on fire can make a Reflex save at the start of each turn, extinguishing the flames on a successful save. Submersing or dousing the target with water will not stop the burning, but does immediately grant a new save with a +4 bonus. The object or creature keeps this bonus on subsequent saves so long as it remains sufficiently doused or submersed. If not extinguished, the flames die out after a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the initial damage increases by 2d6 and the burning damage increases by 1d6. Element Water Effect Your body disperses into vapor as an immediate action, granting you total concealment (50% miss chance). This does not prevent creatures from targeting you. The effect ends after you are targeted by a single attack or effect (whether it hits or not) or at the start of your turn, whichever comes first. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the concealment lasts against an additional attack or effect. Element Earth Effect The ground beneath your foe violently shakes. A single creature within 30 feet takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone; this damage is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the prone effect. Only creatures of Medium size or smaller are knocked prone on a failed save. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 2d6. For every two spell levels above 1st, you can target an additional creature and the maximum size of creature you can knock prone increases by one size category. Element Air Effect A lightning bolt strikes your target. A creature or object within 30 feet takes 2d6 electricity damage; a creature struck is dazed and takes a -2 penalty to AC for 1 round. A Reflex save halves the damage and AC penalty and negates the daze effect. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the damage increases by 2d6 and the AC penalty increases by 1. Element Air Effect The wind surges around you. As a swift action, you gain a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If you already have a fly speed, you increase it by 20 feet, instead. When the effect ends, if you do not have a fly speed from another source, you fall slowly to the ground (as a fly spell). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the fly speed (or bonus to a fly speed) increases by 10 feet and the duration increases by 1 round. For every three spell levels above 1st, your maneuverability increases by one step (from average to good, then from good to perfect). Element Earth Effect You conjure a piercing stone shard to impale your foes. Make a ranged attack against a target within 30 feet. The stone deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit per caster level (max 3d6); this counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If you hit a creature, it begins bleeding for 1d6 damage each round. Boost For every spell level above 1st, the maximum initial damage increases by 3d6. For every two levels above 1st, the bleed damage increases by 1d6. Element Air Effect You surround a single willing creature within 30 feet of you with a crackling aura of electricity. Any creature striking the target with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack takes 1d6 electricity damage. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Boost For every spell level above 1st, the duration increases by 1 round. For every two levels above 1st, the damage increases by 1d6. Element Earth Effect Your body turns to stone. As a swift action, you solidify into solid rock. While stone, you add your Intelligence modifier to your Armor Class and CMD (minimum +1) and gain DR 2/adamantine. You cannot take any actions, move, or speak while turned to stone, though you are not considered helpless. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Boost For every spell level above 1st, increase the bonus to your CMD by 2 and the DR you gain by 1. For every two spell levels above 1st, increase your bonus to AC by 1, and you gain a stacking 25% chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks while you are stone. Element Air Effect A deafening burst of thunder erupts from you. Creatures within 10 feet of you take 2d6 sonic damage and are deafened for 1 minute. A Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the deafening effect. Boost For every spell level above 1st, increase the damage by 2d6. For every two levels above 1st, you can increase the radius of the burst by 10 feet. Element Any Effect You protect an ally from the elements. A willing creature within 30 feet takes half damage from a single energy type for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This reduction is applied after energy resistance, protection from energy, and other similar effects. The type of damage is based on the element of spell used acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire). Boost For every spell level above 1st, you can target an additional ally.

You can activate this boost after making a successful attack or combat maneuver check. One ally within 30 feet gains another saving throw against a non-instantaneous effect that allows a saving throw affecting them. This saving throw has the same DC as the original save. If your ally succeeds, the effect ends. The ally does not suffer any additional effects for failing the save (such as a poisons damage). You cannot grant an ally more than one additional save against a given effect. Augment You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways|||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
Insights (Cabalist)|General|The following represent the insights available to cabalists. Each one is divided into three parts level, binding, and effect. Insights are sorted first by their level, then binding type, then finally by their name. Level The power of the insight. An insight can be a lesser, greater, or master insight. At first, the cabalist can only select lesser insights, but can select greater insights at 8th level and master insights at 14th level. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Upon entering the formless body binding, you can change your appearance into someone else. You can transform into any Small or Medium humanoid creature (similar to an alter self spell), but except for your size your statistics and abilities do not change. The transformation lasts as long as you remain in the binding. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Your limbs can contort and stretch abnormally. You can use your cabalist level in place of your base attack bonus to determine your CMD, and can also use your cabalist level in place of your base attack bonus to determine your CMB when performing a grapple maneuver. Your binding bonus applies to all combat maneuvers you attempt, not just those that are considered weapon attacks. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Your body changes in disturbing ways. Add your binding bonus to Intimidate checks. If you use Intimidate to successfully demoralize a creature within your reach, they provoke an attack of opportunity from you. A creature can only provoke an attack of opportunity from you once per round in this way. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Your binding makes you stronger than your build would otherwise imply. Add twice your binding bonus to Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks. For every point of your binding bonus, you treat your Strength score as if it were +4 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity and how much you can lift, drag, or carry. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect A trace of eldritch corruption infuses your being, imparting its power onto your attacks. Whenever you successfully strike with a weapon or natural attack, the target begins to bleed, taking damage each round equal to your binding bonus. This bleed damage stacks to a maximum equal to your cabalist level. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Your limbs mutate into hulking bludgeons, masses of writhing tendrils, or some other unnatural form. You gain two slam attacks which deal 1d6 damage on a hit (1d4 if you are Small). These are considered primary natural attacks. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect Your base speed is increased by 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet per point of your binding bonus. Level Lesser; Binding Formless Body Effect When you enter into the formless body binding, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your cabalist level. These temporary hit points last until you leave the formless body binding or until depleted. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect The twisted workings of your mind lash out at attempts for control. When another creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you (whether you make any required saving throw or not), that creature must attempt a Will save or become staggered for 1 round. Mind-affecting abilities that you willingly allow to affect you do not trigger this ability. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures that are immune to confusion are also immune to the effects of your distorted psyche. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect Your mind is open to multiple causalities, letting you subtly alter the results of actions taken. Once per binding when an opponent makes a successful attack roll against you, you can use an immediate action to force them to reroll the attack. You must do so before the damage of the attack is rolled, and they must use the new result, even if it is worse. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect Touching the incomprehensible minds beyond the stars has given you knowledge of dark secrets. Add your binding bonus to Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks. You can make all Intelligence-based skill checks untrained. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself) rolls to randomly determine their action when confused or insane, they must roll twice and you get to choose the result they take. While you are confused (for any reason), you can add your binding bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls, and if the result of your confusion roll is attack the nearest creature, you can select which creature to attack if more than one creature is equally close to you. As a swift action or a move action, you can voluntarily confuse yourself, as the spell confusion. You can end confusion you impart on yourself with this insight at any time as an immediate action, but not confusion inflicted on you in any other way. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect You gain darkvision to a range of 30 feet times your binding bonus. If you already have darkvision, its range is increased by this amount, instead. Add your binding bonus to Perception checks you make. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect While in your opened mind binding, you can unleash a blast of psychic energy onto a creature within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Make a ranged touch attack to hit the target creature. On a hit, they take damage equal to 1d6 per two cabalist levels plus your Intelligence modifier. This damage ignores damage reduction. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect As a standard action, you can peer through a creatures form to see the underlying weakness within. Make a single attack with a weapon or natural attack you have. For this attack, you ignore any concealment less than total concealment, and if you hit you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage per two cabalist levels (max 10d6). You can use this attack once per binding. Level Lesser; Binding Opened Mind Effect A voice within your mind occasionally forewarns you of dangers. Add your binding bonus to Reflex saves and initiative checks. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Your alien anatomy grants you resilience to ailments and afflictions. You become immune to poison and disease while in the formless body binding. If you were affected by a poison or disease prior to entering the binding, those effects are suspended so long as you remain in the formless body binding, but returns once you exit the binding (time spent in formless body counts against their duration). Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Once per binding as a standard action, you can cause your physique to shift and distort in terrible ways. This allows you to make an Intimidate check to demoralize any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see your abhorrent transformation. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Your internal structure morphs unpredictably, shielding you from otherwise grievous injury. You have a 50% chance of negating critical hits and sneak attacks. This does not stack with other effects that reduce the chance of being struck by a critical hit, such as the fortification armor property. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect You twitch and slide eerily around, as a puppet on a string. Once per binding, you can move up to half your base speed as a swift action. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Your body stitches itself together, allowing you to move despite grievous injury. You are no longer disabled when at 0 hit points are lower, and do not fall unconscious when below 0 hit points. While at 0 or fewer hit points, you gain fast healing equal to twice your binding bonus. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Your limbs elongate abnormally, increasing your reach by 5 feet. Level Greater; Binding Formless Body Effect Your inhuman strength allows you to strike with deadly effect. Double the critical range of weapon attacks and natural attacks you make. This does not stack with other effects that increase critical range, such as the Improved Critical feat or keen weapon property. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect You view the world with a bizarre, emotionless logic. Any cabalist spells you cast are treated as affected by the Logical SpellOA metamagic feat without increasing their level or casting time. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect Injury inflicted upon you creates a psychic disturbance within the attacker, deterring further attacks. When another creature within 30 feet of you deals damage to you, they must make a Will save or take 1d8 damage per point of your binding bonus. If the creature that attacked you did so due to confusion or a similar insanity, the damage inflicted is doubled and they take a -2 penalty to their saving throw against the effect. This can only affect a particular creature once per round. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect You force your way into the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you as long as that creature understands language. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect With every spell, you siphon away a portion of your foes will, allowing your magic to grow in strength. Each time a creature fails a saving throw against your cabalist spells, you gain a +1 insight bonus to the caster level of all cabalist spells you cast. Apply the bonus to caster level only after the spell resolves. This bonus stacks to a maximum of your binding bonus, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you leave the opened mind binding, whichever comes first. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect You realize that perspective is but an illusion forced upon you by lesser minds. You can view from any space within 30 feet of you at the same time. Essentially, you can treat yourself as standing in any space within 30 feet for the purpose of determining what you can see, including for effects requiring line of sight. This does not, however, grant you line of effect to whatever you see. This can allow you to see around corners, behind a barricade, further through obscuring mist, or even through walls. You must be at least passively aware of the location you wish to see (for example, you could use this to see on the opposite side of a door, but not the opposite side of a secret door that you dont know exists). This only affects vision, not any other senses. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect You speak words of madness that overwhelm the minds of nearby creatures. As a standard action, you can speak these terrible revelations, causing any number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you to become confused for 1 round. A successful Will save negates the effect. If you are babbling due to confusion or a similar effect, you can use this insight as part of babbling incoherently (even though you normally wouldnt be able to take actions). If you do, the creatures are confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save and staggered for 1 round on a successful save. A creature can be subjected to this effect multiple times, but once they succeed on their saving throw they cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent, compulsion effect. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect Omens come to you instinctively, warning you of threats. You gain both the uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge class features, as a rogue equal to your cabalist level. Level Greater; Binding Opened Mind Effect Whispers speaking of grand revelations grant you insight when needed most. Once per binding as a swift action before rolling an attack roll or skill check, you can choose to roll twice and take the better result. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect Your body flows around strikes to reduce injury, granting you DR 5/. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect Innumerable mouths grow across your body, hungry for sustenance. When you succeed on a melee weapon attack or natural attack, you recover hit points equal to your binding bonus. If the damage dealt was due to a grapple check or the constrict ability, the amount recovered increases to half your cabalist level. You cannot recover more hit points than the amount of damage you dealt with the attack, nor can you recover more hit points than the attacked creature had remaining. You can only leech hit points from living creatures, and striking a creature that is immune to bleed effects prevents this ability. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect You endure injuries that you should logically have no means to survive. When you would be killed by any effect (such as by loss of hit points or a death effect), you negate that effect and are instead left at 1 hit point, as long as you had at least 1 hit point before the effect took place. Once this effect occurs, you immediately exit your binding and cannot re-enter any of your bindings until you recover at least half (50%) of your hit points. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect Your attacks wrack foes with debilitating pain. Whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon or natural attack, the target takes your choice of either 1d3 Strength damage or 1d3 Dexterity damage. If the weapon you use has a x3 critical multiplier, the ability damage increases to 1d4, and if the weapon has a x4 multiplier or higher, it instead increases to 1d6. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect A surge of aberrant power flings your enemy like a childs plaything. Once per binding as a standard action, you can make a combat maneuver check against a foe within your reach, adding double your binding bonus to the check. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the target takes damage as if you hit it with a weapon you are wielding or a natural attack, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and it falls prone. You can only push the opponent in a straight line, and it cant move closer to you than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponents move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect Physical debilitations no longer limit you. You ignore any penalties imparted by ability score damage or drain while in the formless body binding, as well as any magical penalties to your ability scores such as from ray of enfeeblement. This does not make you immune to ability damage or drain, just the penalties associated with them (including any penalties imparted by having ability damage or drain equal to or greater than the associated ability score). Level Master; Binding Formless Body Effect Merely witnessing your form is enough to instill terror. You gain the unnatural aura universal monster ability to a range of 30 feet. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you that are suffering from a fear effect have the penalties from fear increased by 1 and apply that penalty to their AC, in addition to the normal effects. Level Master; Binding Formless Body Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect Ancient magics infuse your being, preventing other magic from taking hold. You gain Spell Resistance equal to 12 + your cabalist level. This Spell Resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered, though it is still removed upon exiting the opened mind binding. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect Pain you inflict on yourself resonates to those around you. As a standard action, you can attack yourself, inflicting damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength bonus to yourself; this ignores damage reduction and cannot be reduced in any way. When you do, any number of creatures within 30 feet of you of your choice take damage equal to the amount you took plus an additional 1d8 per point of your binding bonus and become sickened for a number of rounds equal to your binding bonus. This damage is mental and ignores damage reduction. A Will save negates the sickening effect and halves the damage. If you would injure yourself due to a confusion effect (by rolling to damage yourself with an item in hand), you can use this ability automatically in place of that action, and the damage you inflict on other creatures is doubled. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect Aware of the multitudes of reality, you can push yourself outside of its boundaries. Attacks against you suffer a 20% miss chance. This is not considered concealment. Abilities that allow sight across multiple planes of existence or effects that block planar travel (such as dimensional anchor) can negate this miss chance. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect You have a sense of trials to come. You can always act in the surprise round and can choose your initiative result rather than rolling. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect Your magic saps away the defenses of your enemies. Every time you cast a cabalist spell on a creature (either targeting it or including it in the spells area), it takes a -1 penalty to all saving throws. Apply this penalty before resolving the spell. The penalty stacks to a maximum equal to your binding bonus and lasts for 1 hour, even if you leave the opened mind binding. You can choose not to inflict this penalty, if desired (such as when casting upon allies). Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect The thoughts of creatures draw you in like a moth to flame. You have blindsight to a range of 30 feet, but only to detect sentient creatures. Mindless creatures are not detected with this sense. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind Effect A single touch allows you to reach into the minds of your victims to draw out their thoughts. Once per binding after successfully making a weapon attack or natural attack against a creature, you can use a free action to force it to make a Will save. If it fails, it is stunned for 1 round, and you learn its surface thoughts as if by a detect thoughts spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. Level Master; Binding Opened Mind|effect your limbs grow writhing tendrils and needling suckers. you gain the final embraceuc feat, even if you dont meet the . you can ignore all of the final embrace horroruc and final embrace masteruc feats aside from base attack bonus, but can only use them in the formless body binding.|effect within your mind lies a paradox so fundamental that it defies reason. you gain the constant of mind blank while in the opened mind binding.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Construct Companions (Vanguard)|General|A construct companions abilities are determined by the vanguards level and by the augmentations selected by the vanguard. The base statistics are outlines in Table Construct Companions. Each construct companion has a chosen form that modifies these base statistics. Construct companions are treated as constructs for determining what spells affect them. Bonus Bonus Class Level This is the characters vanguard level. HD This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the companion possesses. As the construct companion has no Constitution score, it does not get any bonus hit points from its Constitution modifier (treat its Constitution as 10 for determining its hit points). However, as a Medium-sized construct, it gains 20 additional hit points due to its size. BAB This is the construct companions base attack bonus. A construct companions base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Construct companions do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for having a high base attack bonus, though they do gain additional attacks when using manufactured weapons, as normal. Saving Throws This is the constructs base saving throw bonuses. As a construct, the companion has no good saving throws. Skills This lists the construct companions total skill ranks. A companion can assign skill ranks to any skill. The values shown in Table Construct Companion are the base value, assuming the companion has an Intelligence score of 10. Companions with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (a construct companion receives a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). A companion cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Feats This is the total number of feats possessed by a construct companion. Companions can select any feat that they qualify for. Armor Bonus The number noted here is the construct companions base armor bonus. The construct cannot wear any armor, as it interferes with the vanguards link with the companion. Primary Ability Bonus Add this bonus to the construct companions two primary ability scores. These are determined by the companions base form. Special This includes a number of abilities gained by all construct companions as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below. Companion Traits (Ex) A construct companion is not built nor animated as a typical construct. It is powered by the vanguards innate power and intuition rather than careful design, and as such has different abilities from a normal construct. A construct companion has all traits and immunities a normal construct has, except as noted here. Construct companions are not immune to mind-affecting effects, including charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects. A construct companion has an Intelligence score and gains feats and skill ranks as appropriate for its level, as shown in Table Construct Companions, and has class skills. A companion has the same weapon proficiencies as the vanguard and can use shields (except tower shields). Integrated Equipment (Ex) A construct companion can have its weapons or shield integrated into its body, rather than having to hold and stow them as a normal piece of equipment. Any manufactured weapon or shield that is of appropriate size for the construct companion can be integrated. Integrating equipment takes 1 hour of work by the vanguard. After doing so, the item is built directly into the constructs form. It can bring forth the weapon or shield and store it back in its body as if drawing it normally, including reductions in time from feats such as Quick Draw. When stored, the equipment is inside the companions body and cannot be seen, and its magic aura (if any) cannot be found with spells such as detect magic unless the spell can penetrate through the constructs metallic body. When it draws an integrated weapon or shield, it replaces the hand necessary to wield the item, at which point it can be used as if wielded normally. An integrated weapon or shield cannot be disarmed or stolen, as its attached directly to the constructs body, though it can be sundered or attacked as normal. A construct companion can have up to three pieces of integrated equipment at once. If the companion has an integrated ranged weapon, the vanguard can integrate ammunition along with it. Up to 50 pieces of ammunition can be integrated with each ranged weapon. Reloading an integrated weapon is no faster than reloading the weapon as normal, and can be reduced by feats and abilities such as Rapid Reload possessed by the companion. Integrating more ammunition takes 10 minutes of work by the vanguard. Once a piece of equipment is integrated, it cannot be removed intact. Removing integrated equipment involves either destroying the equipment (though sunder checks and the like) or spending 1 hour removing the item, the process of which gives it the broken condition but leaves it intact enough to be repaired via make whole or similar magic. Removing a ranged weapon requires removing its integrated ammunition, if any. Link (Ex) A construct companion is not made nor controlled as a normal construct; it is instead tied to the vanguards own magical essence, and as such the vanguard shares a special link with his companion. The vanguard can communicate empathically with the companion, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the links limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The vanguard has the same connection to an item or place that the companion does. However, such a link has its drawbacks. As the companion is powered by the vanguards magic essence, the construct cannot move more than 100 feet away from the vanguard at any time. If it does, the construct companion immediately shuts down, rendering it helpless and unable to act. The vanguard must be able to exercise mental control to keep the companion functioning. If the vanguard is ever unconscious, asleep, killed, stunned, or confused, the companion cannot act and is considered helpless. In addition, magic items interfere with the vanguards link to his companion. As a result, the vanguard and his companion share magic item slots. For example, if the vanguard is wearing a ring, the companion can wear no more than one ring. If there is a conflict, the item worn by the vanguard remains active while the item worn by the construct become dormant. Magic weapons do not interfere with the vanguards link with his companion. Despite being animated by magic, the construct does not shut down in an antimagic field, though some of its other abilities may be negated. Share Spells (Ex) The vanguard may cast a spell with a target of you on his construct companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A vanguard may cast spells on his companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companions type (construct). Spells cast in this way must come from the vanguard spell list. This ability does not allow the companion to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells. Ability Score Increase (Ex) The construct companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores. Devotion (Ex) A construct companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. Greater Link (Ex) The constructs link with the vanguard improves. The companion can now move up to 200 feet away without any penalty. If it moves further than 200 feet away, but less than 500 feet away, the companion is staggered. If it moves more than 500 feet away, the companion shuts down and is considered helpless. In addition, the construct companion can still act normally whenever the vanguard is stunned or confused, though it still cannot act if the vanguard is unconscious, asleep, or killed. The following are class skills for a construct companion Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), and Perception (Wis). A constructs base form grants four additional class skills, as listed in the forms entry. In addition, any construct companion that gains a fly speed receives Fly (Dex) as a class skill, regardless of what level it obtains its fly speed. Each construct companion has one of three base forms that determines its starting speed, AC, skills, and ability scores (including its primary ability scores). The companion also gains two slam attacks that deal 1d4 damage, regardless of its form. They are primary natural attacks, meaning they use the constructs full base attack bonus. Each slam attack require a free hand for the construct to make the attack. A construct companion is always Medium sized and typically humanoid in shape (two arms, two legs, head, and torso). The appearance of the companion is otherwise left to the vanguard to decide and has no impact on its abilities.

Nightblade|General|For some, darkness is not a hindrance, but a powerful ally. Quietly stepping between shadows, nightblades are experts of stealth and subtlety, blending agile combat with potent magic to outwit and overwhelm their foes. Nightblades excel at using shadow magic in innumerable ways, making them adaptable and unpredictable. The powers of darkness are not easily learned, however; the near limitless possibilities of shadow magic are instead divided into several teachings, each one as wildly different as the last. From overwhelming fear to convincing illusions, or from limitless creation to untold entropic destruction, each nightblades powers grant them the means to take on any challenge. Role Nightblades, if nothing else, are flexible, capable of adapting to situations as needed. Their skill with stealth, deception, and infiltration make all nightblades excellent scouts, spies, or assassins. Their chosen path allows a nightblade to excel in a certain area, making no two nightblades identical. Alignment Any Hit Die d8 Starting Age Self-Taught Starting Wealth 4d6  10 gp (average 140 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. CLASS SKILLS The nightblades class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). Skill Ranks Per Level 6 + Int modifier. All of the following are class features of the nightblade. A nightblade is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, scythe, short sword, shortbow, and spiked chain. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields. A nightblade can cast nightblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like other arcane spellcasters, a nightblade wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components. A multiclass nightblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. A nightblade casts arcane spells drawn from the nightblade spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a nightblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a nightblades spell is 10 + the spell level + the nightblades Charisma modifier. A nightblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table Nightblade. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). A nightblades selection of spells is extremely limited. A nightblade begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the nightblades choice. At each new nightblade level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table Nightblade Spells Known (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a nightblade knows is not affected by her Charisma score. The numbers on Table Nightblade Spells Known are fixed.). These new spells can be common spells chosen from the nightblade spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the nightblade has gained some understanding of through study. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third nightblade level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a nightblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the nightblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spells level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level nightblade spell she can cast. A nightblade may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. A nightblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not used up her allotment of spells per day for the spells level. Nightblades learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table Nightblade Spells Known under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. The teachings of shadow magic are complex and diverse, but mastering all of its powers is nearly impossible. Instead, nightblades focus on a particular aspect of shadow magic, greatly enhancing their capabilities in that area. Each nightblade must choose a path at 1st level, representing the specialization of her shadow magic. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. A nightblade gains a technique for her path at 1st level, 5th level, and every five levels thereafter. The techniques a nightblade gains are described in her chosen path. Each path also has an associated path power, which the nightblade can use once per day. The nightblade can use this power an additional time per day at 4th level and every three nightblade levels gained thereafter. The nightblades path also grants her additional class features, including an ability that utilizes shadow surges (see below) and more choices when selecting nightblade arts. These features are described in the paths entry. The DC to save against any path powers, techniques, and so on is equal to 10 + 1/2 the nightblades level + her Charisma modifier, unless otherwise noted. A full list of nightblade paths can be found here. At 2nd level, the nightblade gains the ability to create a condensed reserve of energy from the Plane of Shadow. She can spend a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to gain a single shadow surge. A shadow surge is a renewable resource that the nightblade can use to fuel her abilities. She cannot have more than one surge at a time, but there is otherwise no limitation on how many times a day the nightblade can create or use shadow surges. The nightblade has these surges indefinitely until she uses them, though she loses her surges if she is ever unconscious, asleep, or killed, or if she ever loses her shadow, such as from being turned into a vampire or due to a curse of the lightless* spell. The nightblade can expend a shadow surge as a free action when making a Stealth check to enshroud herself in darkness, letting her roll twice and take the better result. In addition, the nightblade gains a method of expending her shadow surge based on her chosen nightblade path. This surge ability is described in the paths entry. The nightblade can gain new ways to use shadow surges as she grows in skill, typically through gaining a nightblade art (see below). As a nightblade gains experience, she learns a number of techniques and powers that enhance her combat skill and shadow magic. Starting at 3rd level, a nightblade gains one nightblade art. She gains an additional nightblade art for every three levels of nightblade attained after 3rd level. A nightblade cannot select a particular art more than once. If a nightblade art calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the nightblades level + her Charisma modifier. A nightblade can choose from any of the following nightblade arts or from any of the arts listed for her chosen path. A full list of nightblade arts can be found here. At 3rd level, the nightblade gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. If she already has this feat, she can choose any other feat she qualifies for. Additionally, she gains darkvision out to 30 feet. At 9th level, this distance increases to 60 feet. If the nightblade already has darkvision, its range is increased by these amounts instead. Starting at 8th level, a nightblade can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light (or darker), a nightblade can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow. A nightblade of 8th level or higher can store up to two shadow surges at once. She can gain both surges with a single full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or gain one surge as a standard action as normal. At 9th level, the nightblade gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The teleportation must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. The nightblade can shift 30 feet per level each day in this manner. This amount can be split among many shifts, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. This ability functions as if casting a dimension door spell for the purpose of qualifying for and using feats such as Dimensional AgilityUC. She cannot bring other creatures along, except her familiar (if she has one), and only if it is within arms reach. Bringing a familiar does not require additional uses of shadow shift. At 12th level, the nightblades shadow spells become more realistic. Any shadow spell or nightblade ability she uses whose realness is represented as a percentage, such as shadow conjuration or the shadow energy path technique, is 20% more real. At 18th level, the realness of these effects increases by an additional 20%. Other increases to the realness of shadow spells stack with these increases. At 14th level, a nightblade can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness out to any distance. A nightblade of 17th level or higher can store up to three shadow surges at once. She can gain all three surges with a single full-round action or can gain a single surge as a standard action.||at 11th level, a nightblades evasion improves. this ability works like evasion, except that while the nightblade still takes no damage on a successful reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. a helpless nightblade does not gain the of improved evasion.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Spirit Companions (Invoker)|General|"A spirit companions abilities are determined by the invokers level and by the combination of its oath and dominion. The base statistics are outlined in Table Spirit Companions. Spirit companions are treated as fey for determining what spells affect them. NOTE Spirit companions are different from most ""companions"" in that they can cast spells and have their own spell list. See below for more details. A list of dominions can be found here. A list of oaths can be found here. The invoker spell list (which spirit companions can cast spells from) can be found here. Bonus Bonus Orisons, Fey Blast Class Level This is the characters invoker level. HD This is the total number of six-sided (d6) Hit Dice the companion possesses, each of which is modified by the companions Constitution, as normal. BAB This is the spirit companions base attack bonus. A spirit companions base attack bonus is equal to half its Hit Dice. Fort/Ref/Will These are the spirit companions base saving throw bonuses. As a fey, the companion has good Reflex and Will saves. Skills This lists the spirit companions total skill ranks. Companions can assign skill ranks to any skill. The values shown in Table Spirit Companion are the base value, assuming the companion has an Intelligence score of 10. Companions with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (a spirit companion receives a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). A companion cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Feats This is the total number of feats possessed by a spirit companion. Companions can select any feat that they qualify for. Natural Armor Bonus The number noted here is the spirit companions natural armor bonus. The spirit companion cannot wear any armor, as it interferes with the invokers link with the companion. Dex/Wis Bonus Add this bonus to the spirit companions Dexterity and Wisdom scores. Special This includes a number of abilities gained by all spirit companions as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below. Fey Blast (Sp) A spirit companion is able to unleash a concentrated bolt of natural energies. As a standard action, the spirit can fire a fey blast at a single target within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels, using the spirits caster level) as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the blast deals damage equal to 1d6 per two Hit Dice possessed by the spirit + the spirits Wisdom modifier. The type of damage the blast deals is based on the spirits dominion, and it is always considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The fey blast counts as a weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus, though it cannot be used with feats that cannot be applied to touch attacks (such as Deadly Aim) nor can it be used in conjunction with Vital Strike feats. The companion is never considered to be wielding the blast and does not threaten with it. Spell Resistance applies against the fey blast. Link (Su) As part of the covenant formed between invoker and spirit, the spirit companion binds its life force to the invoker. If the companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the invoker, it is sickened (no save) and must make a concentration check to cast any spell or lose it. The DC of this check is equal to 20 + the spells level. If the spirit is ever more than 1000 feet away from the invoker or if the invoker is killed, the spirit becomes nauseated and no longer heals naturally from resting. For every 24 hours that pass while the invoker is dead or the spirit is outside of the links range, its takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The sicken, nausea, and Constitution-damaging effects caused by exceeding the links range bypass any immunity to those effects that may be possessed by the companion. Low-Light Vision (Ex) The spirit companion can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Spellcasting A spirit companion can cast a small number of divine spells drawn from the invoker spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a spirit must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spells level. It can cast any spell it knows without preparing it ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a spirits spell is equal to 10 + the spell level + the spirits Wisdom modifier. The strength of a companions magic is directly tied to the strength of the invoker. The spirits caster level for casting invoker spells is equal to the invokers class level, rather than its Hit Dice. It otherwise uses its own feats and statistics for determining the effectiveness of invoker spells it casts. A spirit can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. Its base daily spell allotment is given on Table Spirit Companions. In addition, it receives bonus spells per day if it has a high Wisdom score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). The spirits selection of spells is limited. At 1st level, a spirit knows two 0-level spells of its choice. At each new level, the spirit learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table Companion Spells Known. Unlike its spells per day, the number of spells a spirit knows is not affected by its Wisdom score; the numbers on the table are fixed. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a spirit can learn a single new spell in place of one it already knows. The new spells level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must choose whether to swap the spell at the same time it gains new spells known for the level. Orisons Spirit companions learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table Companion Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Ability Score Increase (Ex) The spirit companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores. Invoked Magic (Ex) The spirit companion has one bonus spell slot per day of each spell level it can cast, not including orisons. It can use these slots to cast spells from the list of spells given by the invokers currently invoked lesser spirits, even if it doesnt know the spell. It can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that it knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell. Devotion (Ex) A spirit companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The following are class skills for the spirit companion Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha). All spirit companions have the same base statistics. Modifications to these statistics are granted by the spirits dominion and oath.

Power Trick|Psionic|Your mastery of a single power is such that you can augment it beyond its normal capabilities. Special You can select the Power Trick feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of power. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Power Trick (cloud mind) feat to use the trick. Subtle Clouding (Invasive) You can expend your psionic focus when you manifest cloud mind, if you do so you can ignore the targets immunity to mind-affecting effects. Cloudbank (Widen Power, Spellcraft 6 ranks) When you manifest cloud mind, you may select a number of additional creatures up to your manifester level to be treated as though they were you for the purposes of the power and hidden from the target of the power. These creatures must all be within 10 feet of you and remain within that distance during the duration of the power. If a creature leaves this distance, it is no longer hidden. Heavy Cloud (Divert Perception, Stealth 6 ranks) You can spend 4 additional power points when manifesting cloud mind, if you do so, the target does not receive any additional saves beyond the first and the power does not end if you attack the target or cause changes to their environment. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Power Trick (ectoplasmic carpet) feat to use the trick. Defensive Carpet (shield proficiency) While in shield mode, your ectoplasmic carpet is treated as a force screen power that has had the same amount of power points spent to manifest it as you spent on the ectoplasmic carpet power. Instant Defense (Riposte Power) You can switch your carpet to shield mode as an immediate action. This lasts until the start of your next turn unless you have the shifting carpet trick. Ectoplasmic Grip (Improved Grapple) While using your ectoplasmic carpet, you may restrain a number of creatures up to your manifester level, so long as all of those creatures are adjacent to another restrained creature. If you have a creature restrained, you may spend a standard action to treat a restrained creature as though you were maintaining a grapple and succeeded on a grapple check against them. If you have the multitask trick and both tripping and restraint modes active, you may instantly restrain a creature if you successfully trip them. Multitask (Twin Power) When you manifest ectoplasmic carpet, you may spend two additional power points to have two modes active at once. If you have the shifting carpet trick, you may change one or both modes at the same time. Shifting Carpet (Spellcraft 6 ranks) Once per turn, as a free action, you may expend your psionic focus and change the mode of the carpet. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Power Trick (mind thrust) feat to use the trick. Mind Crush (Empower Power or Widen Power, Spellcraft 6 ranks) You may manifest mind thrust as a burst power with a radius of 5 feet. For every 2 power points spent on augmenting the power, this radius increases by an additional 5 feet. Alternatively, you may focus your mind thrust severely onto a single target. If you do so, the target takes an additional 50% damage and takes half damage upon making a successful saving throw instead of negating the power. Brain Taser (Dazing Power) When you manifest mind thrust with the Dazing Power metapsionic feat, you may instead cause the target to be stunned. The duration of both this trick and the Dazing Power feat increases by 1 round for every 2 power points spent augmenting mind thrust. If you have the mind crush trick, you may use Dazing Power in conjunction with your burst mind thrust power even though it is not a single target power. Splitting Headache (Sickening Power, Spellcraft 6 ranks) When you manifest mind thrust with the Sickening Power metapsionic feat, you may instead cause the target to be nauseated. The duration of both this trick and the Sickening Power feat increases by 1 round for every 2 power points spent augmenting mind thrust. Neuron Rush (Improved Bull Rush) You may expend your psionic focus when manifesting mind thrust in order to bull rush your target. This bull rush has an attack bonus equal to your manifester level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. If the target saves against your mind thrust, it only takes half damage (this does not stack with the same effect from the mind crush trick) and moves half the distance from the bull rush (minimum 5 feet). In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Power Trick (read thoughts) feat to use the trick. Mind Spy (Focused Power) If you manifest read thoughts with the Focused Power metapsionic feat, you can choose to only target a single specific creature. If you do and that creature fails the saving throw against read thoughts, you may plant a mind spy in that creatures mind. The mind spy lasts for 1 day. While the mind spy is in place, you may concentrate to read the creatures thoughts. Each day, if the mind spy is still active, you may manifest read thoughts again to increase its duration by another day. You may only have one mind spy active at a time. A creature does not know that it has a mind spy, though effects like mind probe or schism may reveal it, and effects like psychic surgery may remove it. Open Communication (Spellcraft 3 ranks) When you manifest read thoughts, you may alter its function. Instead of reading the surface thoughts of creatures within the area, you may communicate with them as though you had the telepathy ability. When manifested in this way, read thoughts becomes a 60 foot radius emanation instead of a cone. Unyielding Presence (Unwilling Participant) If you expend your psionic focus while manifesting read thoughts, you may treat it as though it had no saving throw when attempting to read the thoughts of collective members and may read their thoughts even if they are not in range.|ability to manifest the chosen power or psi-like ability.|you can use any power tricks relating to the chosen power so long as you meet the appropriate power trick requirements.|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
