## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `class_feat_labels` in the `/update_character_data` response: each class bonus feat is tagged with
  its granting class and level (e.g. "Fighter 1") via a new `class_bonus_feat_levels()` schedule
  helper, so the sheet can show class feats as "Fighter 1: Weapon Focus".
- `teamwork_feat_labels` does the same for teamwork feats (Hunter/Inquisitor every 3 levels;
  Cavalier/Samurai), via a `teamwork_feat_levels()` helper — e.g. "Inquisitor 3".
- `land_speed` (base race land speed) is now exported, consumed by the FoundryVTT custom-buffs feature.
- `bloodline_feats` and `bloodline_feat_labels` exports for Sorcerer & Bloodrager: bonus feats drawn
  from the character's own bloodline list, labeled by granting class and level (e.g. "Sorcerer 7",
  "Bloodrager 6"). New `bloodline_bonus_feat_levels()` schedule (Sorcerer 7/13/19/…; Bloodrager
  6/9/12/…, extending past level 20) and `bloodline_feat_chooser()` helper, which strips parenthetical
  specializations so names resolve in the pf1e compendium ("Skill Focus (Knowledge […])" → "Skill Focus").
- `craft_type` export — one Craft specialization rolled per character (new `crafts` list in `data.py`),
  so the sheet can show "Craft: <type>".
- `c_class_display` export — the class name in `every_class.json` format including the Unchained suffix
  (e.g. "Barbarian (Unchained)"), captured before the internal " (unchained)" strip. The FoundryVTT
  module uses it to create the correct class item.

### Changed
- Bonus skill ranks now scale off the FINAL highest mental ability — base score plus inherent bonuses
  and level-up bumps — instead of the base roll, via a new `highest_mental_mod()` helper. An Int/Wis/Cha
  boosted by inherents or level-ups now grants the extra ranks it should.
- Bloodline (Sorcerer/Bloodrager), teamwork (Inquisitor/Hunter/Cavalier/Samurai), monk, and ranger
  bonus-feat slots that exceed the available special-feat pool are now reallocated to extra normal
  feats, so the total feat count is preserved instead of silently dropping the slots. Example: a
  level-40 Bloodrager whose ~7-feat bloodline list can't fill all 12 granted slots now gets the 5
  leftover slots as normal feats.
- `data/feats.csv` is parsed once per run and cached (`grab_and_clean_feats`), instead of being
  re-parsed on every feat-selection call.

### Fixed
- Unchained classes (Barbarian/Monk/Rogue/Summoner) selected in the FoundryVTT dialog no longer
  produce a random class. The dialog sends a slug (e.g. `barbarian-(unchained)`, spaces→hyphens) but
  `chooseClass` only matched the space-separated `class_data` keys, so the four space-named classes
  fell through to a random pick; `chooseClass` now converts hyphens back to spaces. (As before, they
  resolve to their base class for data/archetype lookup.)
- `skill_ranks` is no longer double-JSON-encoded in the `/update_character_data` response, so the
  FoundryVTT module can read the generated skill ranks (they previously arrived as an un-parseable string).
- Sorcerer & Bloodrager bloodline bonus feats now actually reach the response. They were appended to
  `character.total_feats`, which is never exported, so they were silently dropped; they are now selected
  into the dedicated `bloodline_feats` export.
- High-level (>20) generation is no longer extremely slow. Feat-eligibility (`no_prereq_loop`) was
  O(n²) over ~1478 feats and re-run once per requested feat, so cost exploded as feat counts grew with
  level; it's now a single O(n) pass and `choosing_feats` no longer rebuilds its candidate list each
  pick. A level-40 character of any class now generates in ~0.2s.
- Fixed loops that could hang or crash at high level once a candidate pool was exhausted:
  `choosing_talents` (rogue/slayer/etc. talents) could spin or hit `random.choice([])`, and
  `monk_feats_chooser`/`ranger_feats_chooser` could loop forever (ranger's `== 7` break compared a set
  to an int and never fired). Each now stops when its pool runs out.
- Ranger combat-style feats and monk bonus feats were silently discarded in the default (truly-random)
  feat path: `character.feats` was reassigned by the normal-feat selector right after the choosers
  populated it. They now survive (merged once after selection and name-normalized to match the Foundry
  compendium), so rangers actually receive combat-style feats.
- Monks no longer double-count their bonus feats. The allotment was added both by `extra_combat_feats`
  (as labeled class feats) and `monk_feats_chooser`; monk bonus feats now come solely from
  `monk_feats_chooser`, with unfilled slots reallocated to normal feats, keeping the total the same.
- Fighter/Brawler (and other high-bonus-feat classes) no longer crash with "list index out of range"
  when using non-random (curated) feats. `separate_feats_func` popped `story+flaw+flavor+class_feats`
  from the front with unguarded indexing while the curated `build_selector` pool under-produced; it now
  pops from the front bounded by what's available (also fixing a latent every-other selection bug). The
  curated path additionally tops up from the general feat pool when its buckets come up short, so a
  level-40 curated character gets its full feat count instead of a stub.
- Unchained classes now display as their Unchained variant on the FoundryVTT sheet (via the new
  `c_class_display` export) instead of their base class.
