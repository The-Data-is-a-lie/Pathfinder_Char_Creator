The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell\\'s effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell\\'s effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim.Detect magicanddetect evilcan uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect ofstatus, and the creature takes a –2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist.

Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time.

The arcanist can use this exploit to change one weapon or armor special ability to another with an equal cost.

Using this ability requires the arcanist to touch the item as a full-round action and expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir, and doing so provokes an attack of opportunity.

Some discover that their blood lacks the innate power of a sorcerer\\'s, or that deciphering mysteries in ancient tomes requires a degree of scholarly discipline they do not have. Undeterred, such individuals continue their quest by turning to the powerful mysteries of the Outer Rifts, be they blasphemous secrets found in lost ruins, tricks of magic etched into fiendish runestones, or any other dangerous form of sinister exploitation from these horrific realms.Not all arcanists who choose this route are necessarily evil—they justify these exploits by claiming to be in control of their actions and to use the tools of their enemies against them. Nevertheless, those who bend magic using exploits from the Outer Rifts should be wary of attracting the wrong attention or enabling a greater evil than that which they seek to defeat. < h2 class=\"title\">Arcanist ExploitsAll of the following exploits can be learned by arcanists of any alignment, but these exploits come with a risk.If you use an Outer Rift exploit and in doing so reduce your arcane reservoir to 0, you immediately gain the stain of one manifestation from the accursed, demonic, hellbound, or possessed corruption.The GM chooses which corruption, manifestation, and stain you receive; this stain persists for 24 hours.Reducing your arcane reservoir to 0 in this way multiple times within a 24-hour period results in a new stain for each such instance, and each time you do so you reset the timer for all stains gained in this manner to 24 hours.At the GM\\'s option, multiple instances of abusing exploits in this manner could result in a permanent corruption, but otherwise these corruptions are temporary and do not progress.You can never gain a gift from a corruption in this way.Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist\\'s exploit equals 10 + 1/2 the arcanist\\'s class level + the arcanist\\'s Charisma modifier.Blood Tears(Su)SourceHorror Realms pg. 6']}\n",

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them.

The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out.

The weapon can influence at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability (using her class level + her intelligence modifier for any influence skill checks). It must remain within 100 feet of her. She can direct it to attack a foe as a free action when she first uses this ability to animate the weapon, but on subsequent rounds, she must use a move action to set it against a new foe. If its current foe is defeated, the weapon automatically moves to attack the closest enemy. The weapon never willingly attempts to move farther than 100 feet from the magus. The weaponâ€™s Armor Class, hit points, and hardness are as normal for its size. It does not gain attacks of opportunity, nor does it provoke them, unless an opponent tries to grapple it.

For a moment, she literally embodies the weaponâ€™s history and use. Consequently, the magus gains the use of one feat of her choice that directly improves her use of the weapon, such as Weapon Focus or Improved Critical. The magus must meet all of the featâ€™s prerequisitess to gain it; a magus with the black blade class ability uses her magus class level in place of her base attack bonus.

She can choose to take a double move when she uses this feat, and she can move directly up, or horizontally from the roof of one building to another, or across a castleâ€™s moat.

She creates a web of pure energy that can burn, shock, or freeze an opponent. This energy is of a type chosen at the time she selects this major arcana and once chosen it cannot be changed (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). If she makes a successful melee attack before this abilityâ€™s duration ends, she transfers the web of energy to her opponent. He takes 1d6 points of energy damage per two magus class levels she possesses in each round, at the start of her turn, until this abilityâ€™s duration ends. She also gains this extra damage on the attack that transfers the web to the target. Her opponent may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier) to avoid the web; If he succeeds, the magus deals the extra energy damage with her attack but he avoids becoming trapped in the web and does not take any further damage from it.

She does not gain the ability to hang upside down, making it impossible for her to move along any surface that is more than a 90- degree slope with respect to the ground.

For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent.

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule.

The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out.
