    "Dwarf": {
      "Source": "Blood of Shadows pg. 5",
      "Physical Description": ": Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse—no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.",
      "Society": ": The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call \"aggressive negotiations.\"",
      "Relations": ": Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun Half-Orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail, flighty, or \"pretty\" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder—especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.",
      "Adventurers": ": Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.",

          "In southern peaks of the Shattered Range, near Geb and the Screaming Jungle, clans of nomadic dwarves live and travel through ancient tunnels by day, moving to the surface only at night. Though there are no known dwarven cities in this region, the Garundi dwarves claim the extensive tunnels and caverns they move through are the remains of a once=powerful dwarven kingdom, which was struck down by the gods for some long-forgotten offense. These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains. Desert dwarves often have the craftsman, mountaineer, and rock stepper alternate racial traits. Most also have the desert delver alternate racial trait described below."

          "Two tribes of dwarves reside in the Mwangi Expanse: the Mbe’ke and the Taralu. The Mbe’ke build cities in the mountains of the Terwa Uplands, while the Taralu live in small clans in the eastern jungle. Although there is little contact between the two groups, they share a reverence for and affinity with dragons—most especially cloud dragons— as well as any draconic creature that can be reasoned with, including wyverns. Mwangi dwarves often take the magic resistant or surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who form the strongest spiritual bonds to some form of dragon sometimes also have the breath weapon alternate racial trait described below."

Ouat caste dwarves seek to become closer to divinity by overcoming their mortal limitations. They train themselves and others in the monastic city of Tar Kuata, constantly striving to put aside petty material concerns to focus on spiritual growth. The Ouat’s focus on the power of will and self-improvement causes many of them to take the relentless and stubborn alternate racial traits. Those who begin the path to inner awareness very early in their lives also sometimes take the iron within alternate racial trait described below."

        "Pahmet Dwarves": [
          "The Pahmet have been present in Osirion since ancient days and claim to have been sent by the gods to warn the pharaohs of impending crises and disasters. Though most scholars suspect that claim is more legend than history, the ancient pharaohs of Osirion treated the Pahmet with great reverence. In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait. Many Pahmet have the lorekeeper, mountaineer, rock stepper, and surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who come from long lines of keepers who dedicate themselves to the guarding of tombs also often have the death’s end alternate racial trait described below."

Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait. Most Paraheen from older families tend to have the iron citizen alternate racial trait described below."

          "When the dwarves successfully completed the Quest for Sky, they set about constructing 10 Sky Citadels, massive fortresses that formed the basis for dwarven kingdoms in the Inner Sea region. While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few—such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold—remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits. Because of the eon-long histories of the Sky Citadels, their citizens also often have the deep tradition alternate racial trait described below."

      "Physical Description": ": Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones.",
      "Society": ": Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty, and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have makes such friends rare.",
      "Relations": ": Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his \"special friend\" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is \"so much better than the rest of his kind.\" Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to accomplish such goals. serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification.",

This need to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more, enriched both in treasure and in worldview. For those elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes—watching friends and family swiftly age and die—is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal.",

Unlike many of the elves of Avistan, the Ekujae remained on Golarion despite the calamity of Earthfall and tell tales of having defeated a “Great Darkness” after the disaster. They still hone their skills for war and are ever ready to fight the Darkness if it returns. Due to this ancient responsibility, Ekujae hold to strict traditions in many matters, including the burying of their fallen and the act of swearing oaths and ritualized agreements.Like other elves, Ekujae have keen intellects and are skilled in magical lore, including what has been passed down through their oral traditions and the numerous secrets of the Mwangi Expanse.

Some Forlorn have adopted a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, such as recklessness or substance abuse; others develop antisocial tendencies and keep others at arm’s length to avoid the pain of loss. Still others learn to accept the brevity of the lives around them, cherishing what time they have with friends while they still have it.Forlorn are the most common wanderers of elvenkind, whether they’re traveling widely to avoid attachment or relishing travel with short-lived companions, and many become adventurers. Some find their way to elven lands, where their kin sympathetically welcome them, while others avoid such places out of bitterness or fear of rejection. Forlorn elves frequently have the envoy and urbanite alternate racial traits; some also have the devoted companion alternate racial trait described below."

          "The elves of Jinin are descended from those who traveled underground millennia ago to escape Earthfall. Led by the oracle Jininsiel and guided by a vast, treelike vein of mithral, these elves emerged in Tian Xia, where they founded the nation of Jinin. Jininese elves have adopted many of the customs of their human and samsaran neighbors—Jinin’s culture places great emphasis on artistic pursuits, especially those involving mithral, which serves as a national symbol, lucrative export, and treasured cultural relic for Jininese elves. The elves of Jinin are far less isolationist than many other elven cultures, freely permitting outsiders into Jinin; likewise, while most Jininese elves remain there, many travel or settle across the Dragon Empires and beyond.Jininese elves frequently have the dreamspeaker and envoy alternate racial traits, as well as the Jininese weapon mastery alternate racial trait described below."

Snowcasters rarely journey outside their homes or meet with outsiders. The primary exceptions to this are the twilight speakers, who serve as emissaries to the outside world. Less commonly, Snowcasters who have been exiled, who have lost their homes to monsters, or who are simply overcome with wanderlust may journey to the outside world to seek a new life.Snowcasters frequently have the desert runner, elemental resistance (cold), and fleet-footed alternate racial traits; a few have the frostmelding alternate racial trait described below."

In recent years, some younger Spiresworn have begun to question their isolationist traditions.

      "Physical Description": ": Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient, and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.",
      "Society": ": Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other races. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a \"gnome quarter,\" and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them.",
      "Relations": ": Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other races, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways the very fact other races see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd about other races, and this leads to a strong lack of common ground upon which understanding and relationships can be built. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. Even if this turns out not to be the case, the gnomes continue to look for commonalities in their dealings with each other. The inability or unwillingness of members of other races to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters, with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their hearts are generally in the right place.

Gnomes are prone to powerful fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural world.",

Many gnomes see adventuring as the only worthwhile purpose in life, and seek out adventures for no other motive than to experience them. Other gnomes desire to find some lost lore or material that has ties to their chosen vocation and believe only dragon hoards and ancient ruins can contain the lore they need, which can result in gnomes who think of themselves as bakers or weavers being just as accomplished adventurers as those who declare themselves to be mages or scouts.",

They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent, however.

This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mind-sets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in.",

Snowcaster clans vary in their acceptance of these children, but the average clan’s seclusion from humanity and inability to understand half-elves almost invariably ends up driving the snowborn away. Twilight speakers, however, tend to enjoy a particularly close relationship with their snowborn children, and the two groups often wander together. Snowborn have their elven parents’ snowy white skin and particularly sharp ears. Some Snowcaster half-elves find welcome homes among the Jadwiga and Ulfen communities, as well as the Erutaki tribes.

They get along fairly well with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but these races often live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for interaction.

While Half-Orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, Half-Orcs are as varied as their human parents.",
      "Society": ": Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, Half-Orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by humans who don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, Half-Orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn Half-Orcs, as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors.",

Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature—rather, most Half-Orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves. Half-Orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-Orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron—depending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the Half-Orcs' personal preference. Many Half-Orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding; even a Half-Orc divine spellcaster may wrestle with doubt and anger about religion and faith.",

Of all the Half-Orcs, gloomkin face the harshest treatment; they are punished and abused from birth for what orcs consider the taint of their bloodline. As the bottom of the social ladder in orc society, gloomkin are assigned the task that very few orcs take on willingly: reading.

Among desert orc tribes, the ability to tolerate harsh sunlight is a sign of strength, and weathering the sun is a rite of passage. Lacking their ancestors’ light sensitivity, Half-Orcs excel at these contests of endurance and easily earn high positions within their tribes.Desert Half-Orcs also fare better than most among human civilizations. The strong presence of Sarenrae’s followers has led to a culture of forgiveness and understanding that is rare in other parts of Golarion, making it easier for Half-Orcs to thrive. Many desert Half-Orcs believe they are blessed by Sarenrae and become clerics or paladins of her church."

        "Jungle Half-Orcs (Rainkin)": [
          "In the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the few remaining orc tribes have been largely cut off from others of their kind. Isolated since the orc empires collapsed after the Age of Darkness, only a handful of oral retellings recall the true heritage of these orcs and Half-Orcs, and their culture diverges greatly from other orc societies. It is said that some early Mwangi tribes participated in arranged marriages with orcs, leading Half-Orc children to be associated with alliances and prosperity, and true or not, Half-Orcs have been a major part of these orc tribes for generations. Even in the present day, many orcs are willing to pay a large dowry to bring Half-Orcs into their villages, and orphaned Half-Orcs are happily adopted.Because they usually come from rich families, rainkin halforcs often receive better treatment than their orc or human cousins. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy; because Half-Orc children receive the best care, protection, and training, they are usually stronger and more skilled than orcs or humans, increasing the desire to have Half-Orcs in a tribe. While jungle Half-Orcs typically have great pride and selfworth, many are also resentful of the high expectations placed on them from birth and angry to be treated like a commodity by so many. As a result, rainkin have trouble forming close bonds with non-Half-Orcs, so they often create close-knit groups between themselves. Some of these groups even grow large enough to break off and form their own tribes."

          "Cragkin are widespread across Golarion, found across all the mountain ranges of western Avistan. Thanks to their thin frames and quick wits, mountain-born Half-Orcs excel at climbing and acrobatic stunts. Anything less than a vertical cliff face is traversable, and often even that isn’t enough to stop them. To mountain Half-Orcs, obstacles are merely a foothold on their path to the top.Mountain orcs respect bravery, and cragkin have turned fearlessness and reckless abandon into a badge of honor. By using the terrain to their advantage against less surefooted enemies, they can attack from strange angles and gain advantages with just a few quick steps. They often take near-suicidal leaps to strike enemies from above, or trick enemies into falling to their deaths by leading them down impossible paths. Despite their great skill, accidents are common in this treacherous environment, and no one is surprised if one halforc returns after a raid and his companions do not.Many mountain Half-Orcs find a place among Shoanti and Ulfen settlements, where valor in battle is highly prized. As long as they are willing to respect the traditions of their adopted clans, they usually integrate well into these societies and contribute much to the community."

Shaman trainees learn early that cunning and luck are often the only things that offer a chance of survival. They have the shaman’s apprentice and sacred tattoo alternate racial traits."

        "Winter Half-Orcs (Frostkin)": [
          "At the Crown of the World, nomadic clans of orcs live on the frozen wastes. The winter Half-Orcs that live among them are treated as the runts of the pack. However, strength in numbers is vital in the north, as many young do not survive the harsh winters. Even the weakest are provided for as long as they can prove their usefulness. Sewing, cooking, and child-rearing are all valued skills, and winter Half-Orcs who excel at these are treated better than most. Those who would rather prove their worth through their strength do so by hunting, as ritual combat is a frowned upon waste of energy and resources.While Half-Orcs are not well liked in the Linnorm Kingdoms, they may be able to find homes in the Ironbound Isles. Merchants traveling between Tian Xia and Avistan are often willing to hire on a Half-Orc as a guide and bodyguard across the Crown of the World. Winter Half-Orcs who migrate south into Irrisen can find an easier life in the growing Half-Orc communities, but they are unlikely to find any upward mobility unless they show skill at witchcraft."

      "Physical Description": ": The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world's climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, humans' skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live. At the same time, bone structure, hair color and texture, eye color, and a host of facial and bodily phenotypic characteristics vary immensely from one locale to another. Cheekbones may be high or broad, noses aquiline or flat, and lips full or thin; eyes range wildly in hue, some deep set in their sockets, and others with full epicanthic folds. Appearance is hardly random, of course, and familial, tribal, or national commonalities often allow the knowledgeable to identify a human's place of origin on sight, or at least to hazard a good guess. Humans' origins are also indicated through their traditional styles of bodily decoration, not only in the clothing or jewelry worn, but also in elaborate hairstyles, piercing, tattooing, and even scarification.",
      "Society": ": Human society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of other races like elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, ingenuity, and ambition. Other races sometimes envy humans their seemingly limitless adaptability, not so much biologically speaking but in their willingness to step beyond the known and press on to whatever might await them. While many or even most humans as individuals are content to stay within their comfortable routine, there is a dauntless spirit of discovery endemic to humans as a species that drives them in striving toward possibilities beyond every horizon.",
      "Relations": ": Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases, this tendency leads to violence and war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with races who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and Half-Orcs as embarrassments—but the race's diversity among its own members also makes many humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are. Humans may become so absorbed in their own affairs that they remain ignorant of the language and culture of others, and some take this ignorance to a hateful extreme of intolerance, oppression, and rarely even extermination of others they perceive as dangerous, strange, or \"impure.\" Thankfully, while such incidents and movements may taint all of humanity in the eyes of some, they are more often the exception than the rule.",

Some humans assemble into vast barbaric hordes, while others build sprawling cities that cover miles.
