        "aeromantic concoction (su)": " An aerochemist learns to craft a special alchemical concoction. It takes 10 minutes to brew a dose of this concoction, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An aerochemist can maintain only 1 dose of this concoction at a time-if he brews a second dose, any existing concoction becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, an aeromantic concoction that is not in the aerochemist's possession becomes inert until he picks it up again. Anyone other than the aerochemist who attempts to drink his aeromantic concoction is affected in the same fashion as is a non-alchemist who drinks an alchemist's mutagen. When consumed, an aerochemist's aeromantic concoction makes his body become incredibly buoyant for 10 minutes per alchemist level. The concoction grants the aerochemist a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks to attempt high jumps or long jumps, and he is always treated as having a running start when attempting long jumps. In addition, the aerochemist gains the benefits of feather fall for the concoction's duration. At 6th level, the aerochemist gains the benefits of fly for the concoction's duration. At 10th level, the aerochemist can choose to gain the benefits of air walk instead of fly for the concoction's duration. At 14th level, the duration of the concoction increases to 1 hour per alchemist level. An aerochemist with the infusion discovery can instead create a shared alchemical concoction intended for his allies. This shared concoction grants the same benefits as the normal aeromantic concoction, except the duration is only 1 minute per alchemist level its creator has. At 14th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per alchemist level. An aerochemist can have only a standard concoction or shared concoction in effect, not both. This replaces mutagen, swift poisoning, and persistent mutagen. An aeromantic alchemist can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.",

This counts as an ability that modifies the alchemical sapper's bomb, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs. The alchemical sapper can't use his demolition bomb with the fast bombs discovery. An alchemical sapper can only expend one use of his bomb class feature to create a demolition bomb once per day.

A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (with a DC equal to the trip mine's save DC); otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs. If the alchemical sapper expends four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability. Other than demolition bomb, discoveries that modify bombs cannot apply to trip mine. This ability replaces the discovery gained at 6th level.",

The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to the DC for the alchemical trapper's bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts 10 minutes for each alchemist level the trapper possesses. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within that time frame, the trap becomes inert.

If the attack misses, the bomb doesn't deal splash damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency at the end of the alchemist's turn; the exception is when the aquachymist throws a swiftly sinking bomb close to the bottom, in which case it might reach the bottom and explode there.

A Small alchemist can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he's at least 4th level. The GM may approve other animals as mounts. This construct mount acts in most ways as a druid animal companion , using the character's alchemist level as his effective druid level. A construct mount is a construct, but uses the appropriate animal companion's statistics, gaining Hit Dice, skills, feats, and Strength and Dexterity adjustments as the alchemist advances in level. A construct mount has no Constitution score, and instead gains bonus hit points appropriate for a construct of its size. It has an Intelligence score (and skill points), a lower base attack bonus, and better saving throws than a normal construct of its Hit Dice. The mount has all the immunities of a construct (except immunity to mind-affecting effects, since it has a mind). A construct rider can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Handle Animal for all purposes involving his construct mount, though the check still takes a -5 penalty due to the construct mount's unusual nature. To create a construct with a mind and body that are constantly changing and improving, the construct rider must manufacture vast quantities of clockwork or animating reagents. As such, the construct rider can never gain the mutagen or cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class. At first, his mount is a singular masterpiece created during a momentary stroke of brilliance.

As a move action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, the construct mount can apply the potion or extract to itself. Refilling the reservoir is a complicated process that requires a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. Failure destroys the potion or extract.

The alchemist selects a line or cone area when loading the reservoir. Because the construct mount lacks the alchemist's Throw Anything ability, the alchemist's Intelligence bonus doesn't apply to this damage.

Arms of Achaekek : The small barbs that grow on the crimson chymist's arms when she drinks her mantis mutagen grow significantly in size, granting her two claw attacks as natural weapons. These claws deal damage as appropriate for her size (1d4 for Medium crimson chymists) and function as secondary attacks. These claws do not replace the chymist's hands, and she can still use her hands to wield weapons, attack, hold objects, and otherwise use her hands with ease, but she cannot be wearing any item in the wrists slot or any armor-if she dons magic items that occupy the wrists slot or any armor, her claws shrink back to cosmetic barbs that can't be used in combat as long as the armor or wrist items are worn. A crimson chymist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery. Blood Sight : When the crimson chymist is under the effects of her mantis mutagen, her eyes transform, becoming red and multifaceted. This change grants her darkvision to a range of 60 feet and the effects of deathwatch for the duration of her mutagen's effects. If the crimson chymist already has darkvision as a benefit of her race, the range of her darkvision increases by 30 feet while using blood sight. Improved Arms of Achaekek : The claws granted by the arms of Achaekek discovery now function as primary weapons when the crimson chymist makes no attacks with manufactured weapons (the claws function as secondary weapons if the chymist attacks with a manufactured weapon). The damage die of the claws increases by one size category (to 1d6 for Medium crimson chymists), and attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage on a hit. A crimson chymist must be at least 10th level and have the arms of Achaekek discovery before selecting this discovery. Ingest Venom : Once per day as a standard action, the crimson chymist can ingest one dose of any poison without harming herself. The next time she imbibes her mutagen and uses her arms of Achaekek discovery, both claws are envenomed with a dose of the poison she ingested. An ingested venom remains latent in the alchemist's system until she activates her arms of Achaekek discovery or until 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first.

        "source": "Planar Adventures pg. 13 While most alchemists experiment mainly with chemicals and physical materials to create disparate effects, energists tap into the energy of life or death: positive energy or negative energy. Energists are more likely than most alchemists to follow strange traditions and to travel the planes, discussing theories with jyoti, sceaduinars, and undead alike. Energists are often found in lands with unusual variations between life and death, such as Geb, or Virlych in Ustalav. The energist is an unusual archetype in that all who choose this specialized path must select one of two types of energy to focus on-positive energy or negative energy. The mechanics of how this archetype alters the basic alchemist class abilities function the same regardless of this choice, but these two schools of thought are diametrically opposed in every way. Just as positive energy and negative energy react violently when mixing together, energists of opposing themes traditionally interact violently. Although most who choose positive energy tend to be of good alignment and those who focus on negative energy gravitate toward evil, there is no underlying ethical or moral restriction for an energist to adhere to. Positive energy can be used for evil purposes, and negative energy to pursue good goals. But even then, energists whose alignments and philosophies otherwise would seem to match find themselves at odds if their chosen energies oppose the other. To energists, the curious and frustrating nature of their oppositional energy is a constant thorn in the side of their intellects- an ever-present reminder that by choosing to specialize in one, they have forsaken potential discoveries in the other.",
        "energy focus": " An energist chooses whether to pursue the path of positive energy or the path of negative energy. Once selected, this choice can't be changed. If he chooses negative energy, he adds harm as a 6th-level formula and the inflict spells to his alchemist formulae list and removes heal and the cure spells. This alters extracts.",
        "energist bombs (su)": " An energist's bombs deal damage based on the energy he chose at 1st level. If he chose positive energy, his bombs damage undead creatures, dealing an amount of positive energy damage equal to his normal bomb damage. If he chose negative energy, his bombs damage the living, dealing 1d4 points of negative energy damage plus 1d4 additional points at every odd-numbered alchemist level beyond 1st (instead of 1d6). He can't apply discoveries with an asterisk (*) to his bombs. When an energist reaches 10th level, undead damaged by his positive energy bombs must succeed at a Will save or flee for 1 round as if affected by the Turn Undead feat, while living creatures damaged by an energist's negative energy bombs must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. An energist's bombs don't heal creatures normally healed by the energist's chosen energy type. This alters bombs and replaces poison immunity.",
        "healing ampoule (su)": " At 2nd level, as a standard action, an energist can create and throw a healing ampoule of the same energy type as his bombs up to 30 feet, using two of his daily uses of bombs. A living creature subject to a direct hit by a healing ampoule of positive energy regains 1d4 hit points plus an additional 1d4 hit points for every even-numbered alchemist level an energist has beyond 2nd, while a direct hit by a negative energy healing ampoule instead restores an equivalent number of hit points to an undead target. In either case, the energist adds his Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points healed, as if the ampoule were a splash weapon benefiting from his throw anything ability. A healing ampoule has no splash effect on adjacent targets unless it misses the target; if it misses, determine where it lands as if it were a splash weapon. Healing ampoules don't damage creatures normally damaged by the energist's chosen energy type. This alters throw anything and replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level and swift poisoning.",
        "energist resistance (su)": " At 2nd level, an energist gains energy resistance equal to his alchemist level to positive or negative energy, whichever would naturally harm him.

The energy scientist's bombs deal the type of energy damage that corresponds to his attuned element until he regains his daily uses of bombs, at which point he must attune to one element again. If the energy scientist uses a discovery that changes his bomb's damage type to one that is different from that of his attuned element (such as using the acid bomb discovery when the alchemist is attuned to fire), instead of its normal amount of damage, the bomb deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 for every odd-numbered alchemist level. This ability causes the explosive bomb and inferno bomb discoveries to change the bomb's damage type to fire if the alchemist is not attuned to fire. This ability alters bombs and replaces brew potion.",

Success means the alchemist produces a number of canisters of alchemist's fire (from fire and magma elementals), bottled lightning (from air and lightning elementals), deadground dust (from earth and mud elementals), or liquid ice (from water and ice elementals) equal to half the elemental's CR, rounded down.

As long as the fermenter is under the effects of a drug or tincture, or has imbibed an alcoholic drink in the past 10 minutes, her bombs deal 1 additional point of damage per damage die. While this ability is in effect, she also takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls made with her bombs. At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (to a maximum penalty of -5 at 19th level). This replaces poison use.",

Whenever she creates a tincture using Craft (alchemy), she can simultaneously create a number of additional tinctures equal to her Intelligence modifier. She expends resources for each tincture separately, but she attempts a single Craft check and applies the result to each tincture being brewed. This replaces swift poisoning."

Primal reagents retain their potency until the next time the First World innovator regains his extract slots. As part of the same action used to consume an extract, imbibe a potion, throw a bomb, or drink his mutagen, the First World innovator can expend 1 dose of primal reagents for additional effects as described below. Bomb : Expending 1 dose can change either the bomb's damage type or its damage dealt. When changing the damage type, the bomb deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine the type randomly) instead of its normal damage. When changing the bomb's damage dealt, the bomb's die size increases by one step (for example, increasing 1d6 to 1d8), but it deals 1 less point of damage per die rolled. Extract or Potion : Expending 1 dose increases the caster level of the extract or potion by 1. Mutagen : Expending 1 dose grants the First World innovator an additional effect for the duration of the mutagen, determined at random (by rolling 1d4):  halve all benefits provided by the mutagen; imbibing the mutagen immediately either heals 1d4 points of ability damage to one ability score (if applicable) or restores a number of hit points equal to 2d8 plus the First World innovator's alchemist level; the mutagen grants the First World innovator his choice of the benefits of the lingering spirit, preserve organs, or spontaneous healing alchemist discoveries; or the mutagen grants the First World innovator his choice of the benefits of the feral mutagen, tentacle, vestigial arm, or wings alchemist discoveries. He cannot select a discovery if he does not meet its prerequisites. At 6th level, the alchemist can expend multiple doses of primal reagents to apply multiple effects. When throwing a bomb, he can expend 2 doses to change both the bomb's damage type and damage dealt. When imbibing an elixir or potion, he can expend an additional number of doses equal to the extract's or potion's spell level to increase its caster level by 2 instead of 1. When imbibing a mutagen, he can expend 2 doses to roll twice for additional effects, applying both results. At 10th level, whenever the First World innovator or would use a dose of primal reagents to alter the damage type of a bomb, the bomb deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage (determine the type randomly) instead of its normal damage. Additionally, whenever the First World innovator would use a dose to gain an additional effect for a mutagen, he may roll 1d6 for the effect, adding to the list of options above: the mutagen grants immunity to poison and paralysis; or one numeric benefit of the mutagen (such as the natural armor bonus) selected by the First World innovator increases by 1d3.

When loading a firearm, he can infuse the ammunition as a free action. The compounds are unstable, and if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the gun chemist's Intelligence modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the alchemical ordnance becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire the firearm as normal. Each day, the gun chemist can infuse a number of pieces of alchemical ordnance equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier, and he can fire no more than one piece per round. Alchemical ordnance deals damage as normal, plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the gun chemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of the gun chemist's alchemical ordnance increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike ). The explosive nature of alchemical ordnance causes the attack- both the firearm's base damage and the alchemical ordnance's additional damage-to deal full damage to swarms of any size. If the gun chemist uses alchemical ordnance to make a scattering shot with a weapon with the scatter quality, each creature in the area instead takes additional fire damage equal to the alchemical ordnance's minimum damage (so if the alchemical ordnance would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage normally, it deals only 6 points of fire damage with a scattering shot). The gun chemist's alchemical ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields. If anyone but a gun chemist attempts to fire a firearm loaded with alchemical ordnance that is not yet inert, the firearm's misfire value increases by 4. If the firearm would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion deals additional fire damage equal to that of the alchemical ordnance. Alchemical ordnance is treated like an alchemist's bomb for the purpose of discoveries, though such discoveries ignore any effects associated with a bomb's splash damage or radius unless the gun chemist also applies the exploding bullet discovery. A scattering shot modified by a discovery applies additional effects as though affected creatures were caught in the splash damage of a bomb rather than subject to a direct hit.

For example, he automatically adds summon nature's ally I to his formula book at 1st level and adds the next higher-level spell to his formula book each time he gains the ability to use extracts of that level. The horticulturist uses these special extracts to plant a seed that grows into a creature, bypassing the restriction for single target or personal effects. Using these extracts takes 1 round (as the spell's normal casting time), and the creature summoned must be placed in a space adjacent to the horticulturist. The horticulturist can use these extracts to summon only animals and plants on the appropriate summon nature's ally list. Creatures the horticulturist summons with these extracts become creatures with the plant type (gaining low-light vision and immunity to mind-affecting, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects) rather than their normal type, but their attack bonuses, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills don't change. This replaces the mutagen class feature and the discovery normally gained at 2nd level. A horticulturist can't choose mutagen discoveries.",

This alters the bomb class feature.",

The plant familiar has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a bat-like plant familiar can fly) but is treated as a creature of the plant type and has familiar abilities based on the horticulturist's alchemist level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to the horticulturist). An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells or deliver touch spells. If a plant familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level the horticulturist has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. This replaces the discovery gained at 4th level.",

Without preparation, he can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to his Constitution score (after this, he must begin making Constitution checks or risk suffocation); by spending a full-round action preparing himself, he can increase this duration to 1 hour per point of Constitution. The alchemist can survive twice as long as normal without food or water before he starts to take penalties. He can put himself into a state of suspended animation as a move action, and is then unconscious and appears completely dead; he awakens at a preset time or in response to a condition set by him when he enters this state.

He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized, or if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Bluff) against him. If the internal alchemist already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (as a rogue) instead. This ability replaces swift poisoning.",

        "injections (su)": " At 1st level, an interrogator uses his skill with alchemy to create injections. Each day, an interrogator can create a number of injections equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use it. Using an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a -2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to half the interrogator's class level (minimum 1). If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection, the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum. If the melee touch attack fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again-once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a mesmerist's stare or a witch's evil eye hex . Injections are mind-affecting poison effects. This ability replaces bomb.",
        "serums (su)": " At 1st level, an interrogator augments his ability to influence others through supplemental serums. An interrogator prepares his serums at the same time as his injections and he can apply them to any injection as a swift action before he makes the attack roll for the injection. An interrogator knows one serum at 1st level and can learn another serum in place of a discovery. The save DCs of serums are equal to 10 + 1/2 the interrogator's alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. A creature can be under the effect of only a single serum at a time-with the exception of memory modification serum-with any further serums on the same creature replacing the old serum. Unless otherwise noted, a creature that succeeds on its saving throw against a serum is immune to that serum's effects for 24 hours. An interrogator can never gain any sort of mutagen or cognatogen, even from a discovery or another class. This ability replaces mutagen and persistent mutagen. Charming : The injected creature must succeed at a Will save or treat the interrogator favorably, as if affected by charm person with a caster level equal to the interrogator's alchemist level. At 8th level, this serum acts as charm monster Compliance : On a failed Will save, the subject of this injection is affected by a suggestion with a caster level equal to the interrogator's alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to learn this serum. Confusion : On a failed Will save, the injected creature is confused for 1 round per alchemist level the interrogator has. An alchemist must be at least 6th level to learn this serum. Hypnosis : The injected creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round per alchemist level the interrogator has. Memory Modification : On a failed Will save, the target of this serum is affected by modify memory at a caster level equal to the interrogator's alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level to learn this serum. Paralytic : On a failed Will save, the injected creature is affected by hold person with a caster level equal to the interrogator's alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to learn this serum. Truth : A creature injected with a truth serum must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to answer the interrogator's questions truthfully. The interrogator can ask one question per 2 alchemist levels (minimum 1). Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the injected creature is unfriendly, but they aren't false. If a creature has been subjected to a truth serum within the past week, whether it succeeded at or failed its save, any new serum fails."

This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the Advanced Player's Guide of 1 spell level higher than the extract's spell level. For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a fox's cunning effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts. This ability alters alchemy and replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level.",

If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen (including whether to make it a cognatogen or another variant mutagen if she has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it. When the mad scientist drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules on page 12). If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour.

Mnemostil First developed to help heal souls who had experienced undeath for a time, the art of mnemostil involves a practitioner carefully extracting or returning memories as an oily vapor-mnemos-which allows tortured souls to confront their past horrors one at a time while finding closure. In a city largely dedicated to waiting out eternity and cultivating absent passion, however, there are abundant souls eager to feel anything, good or bad. Black-market mnemostillers pay handsomely to extract memories from remarkable souls, even traveling to other planes to build up their stock before returning to Spire's Edge to sell their wares. While there is some crossover with information brokers, mnemostillers typically sell experiences and emotions rather than secrets. Petitioners searching for purpose buy what memories they can to try and shape themselves toward one Outer Plane destination or another, often trading in their genuine memories as payment, until little of the original individual remains. Some criminal syndicates target visiting souls and outsiders to extract their memories by force. Mnemostil has also created a unique faith in Spire's Edge: amnesia cults. Many petitioners succumb to the expectation that they grow-that who they were in life is somehow not enough-and so render themselves into temporary or permanent blank slates to dwell in inert bliss. Others cannot reconcile their own actions and so wipe themselves clean to live in ignorance. Pruning the development of the soul is anathema to the purpose of Spire's Edge, and the city's psychopomps aggressively hunt both mnemostillers and amnesia cultists, with punishment for the crime invariably being exile into the Astral Plane."

The target is considered the imbiber, as if she had drunk an extract prepared with the infusion discovery. As the contents of an atomizer are inhaled, the target must be able to breathe. Atomized extracts are considered extracts for purposes of other abilities, and become inert when not in the alchemist's possession. This alters extracts and replaces brew potion.",
        "effervescent bombs (su)": " Rather than deal direct damage, a perfumer's bombs create an effervescent puddle in a 5-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Each creature within this area takes 1d4 points of fire damage immediately and again each round it remains within or enters the puddle. A creature caught in the puddle when it is first created can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the perfumer's level + the perfumer's Intelligence modifier) for half damage. The effervescent bombs' damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every odd level thereafter. Effervescent bombs otherwise functions as bombs, and discoveries that apply to bombs apply to effervescent bombs. This alters bomb.",
        "pheromones (su)": " A perfumer can spend 1 hour to distill a special mixture of exotic pheromones and alchemical reagents and store it in an atomizer. The mixture remains potent until used or until the perfumer distills another pheromone mixture, at which point the first becomes inert and the duration of its effects immediately end. Spraying this mixture on a willing creature as a standard action grants the target a +4 alchemical bonus to Charisma and a -2 penalty to Constitution for 10 minutes per alchemist level. Additionally, the target creature gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks. This replaces mutagen. A perfumer can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.",
        "persistent pheromones": " At 14th level, the alchemist gains the ability to distill extremely potent pheromones.

Disease is a tool, and the plague bringer is its master. A plague bringer has the following class features.",
        "plague vial (su)": "  At 1st level, a plague bringer can create a plague vial, an alchemically grown and concentrated disease sample. It takes 1 hour to prepare a plague vial, and once prepared, the vial remains potent until used. A plague bringer can only maintain 1 plague vial at a time-if he prepares a second vial, any existing plague vial becomes inert. A plague vial that is not in a plague bringer's possession becomes inert until a plague bringer picks it up again. It's a standard action to drink a plague vial. Upon being imbibed, the plague vial infects the plague bringer's blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids for 10 minutes per class level. Any creature that harms him with melee attacks (except with reach weapons) must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the plague bringer's level + the plague bringer's Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1 round per plague bringer level. The plague bringer is immune to the effect of his own plague vial, but not that of another's plague vial. The effects of multiple plague vials do not stack. As a standard action, the plague bringer can infect a weapon with this sickness (typically by licking it or wiping his blood or pus on it). The disease on the weapon works like a poisoned weapon, except the source is a disease instead of a poison (so a dwarf's resistance to poison does not apply). Anyone other than a plague bringer (including another alchemist) who drinks a plague vial must make a saving throw against the vial's DC or become nauseated for 1 hour. Unless he learns how to brew a mutagen by taking the mutagen discovery , he can never benefit from a mutagen and reacts to it as if he were a non-alchemist. At any particular time, a plague bringer can only be under the effect of either a plague vial or a mutagen (not both); drinking another immediately ends the effects of any ongoing plague vial or mutagen. All limitations to mutagens apply to plague vials as if they were the same substance. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to plague vials. The sticky poison discovery applies to a weapon infected with a plague vial. The plague vial is a disease effect. This ability replaces mutagen.",

This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus.

A tinkerer's familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics and abilities are identical to a clockwork spy with the normal adjustments and abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype. At 3rd level, if the tinkerer has the infusion discovery, a clockwork spy familiar can deliver the tinkerer's extracts with a range of touch for her. At 7th level, a clockwork spy can communicate with constructs with the clockwork subtype. Unlike most familiars, a clockwork spy does not grant special abilities to its master. With 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Heal check, a tinkerer can restore 1d4 hit points to her clockwork spy familiar. At 4th level, a tinkerer can restore 1d6 hit points to her familiar in this same way. This amount increases to an additional 1d6 hit points every 4 levels thereafter (2d6 at 8th level, 3d6 at 12th level, 4d6 at 16th level, and 5d6 at 20th level). This ability replaces mutagen.

When creating such a clockwork item, the tinkerer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous item's construction cost. She need not meet any of the item's other creation requirements. A tinkerer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item or a wondrous item with finite charges, and she can have only one mimicry at a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other creature. The tinkerer can spend 1 hour disassembling a clockwork mimicry and reassembling it into a mimicry of a different wondrous item. When she disassembles a clockwork mimicry, she can salvage parts worth half of the mimicry's creation cost. She still must pay the full creation cost for the new mimicry. This resets the duration the mimicry functions per day. This replaces persistent mutagen.",

Known as toxicants, these deadly artists induce the production of deadly secretions within their own bodies in order to better inflict crippling conditions upon their foes.",
        "toxic secretion (ex)": "  At 1st level, a toxicant has learned to mimic creatures with the ability to secrete harmful toxins through the skin. Once per day, in a process that takes 10 minutes, the toxicant can create and imbibe a tincture that causes her skin to secrete a mild toxin. The toxicant is immune to this secretion, but any creature that hits her with a natural attack or unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the toxicant's alchemist level + the toxicant's Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the toxicant's Intelligence modifier. At 4th level, a target that fails its save must succeed at a second save 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 alchemist levels the toxicant possesses (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). This is a poison effect ( Ultimate Magic 138). The toxicant can suppress this secretion as a standard action, in which case it remains suppressed for 1 hour or until the toxicant reactivates it as a standard action. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the toxicant can choose a condition to have her toxin impose. Once this choice is made, it can't be changed. A creature that fails its save against the toxic secretion also gains these conditions until it succeeds at a save against the secretion, or until the toxin's duration ends. At higher alchemist levels, the toxicant gains access to stronger conditions; some replace lower-level conditions, which must be selected first. The following conditions are available at the given alchemist levels: 3rd-bleed (1d6), dazzled, fatigued, or sickened; 6th-dazed or shaken; 9th-blinded (replaces dazzled) or staggered (replaces dazed); 12th-exhausted (replaces fatigued); 18th-stunned (replaces exhausted and staggered). As a swift action, the toxicant can collect and concentrate this secretion into a poison she can deliver as a touch attack or apply to a weapon. Targets of such attacks must attempt saving throws as if they had touched the toxicant's toxic secretion. The toxicant can do this a number of times per day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces mutagen.",
        "toxic digestion (ex)": "  At 14th level, a toxicant can drink a poison as a standard action and suspend it within her own body. She is not affected by the poison, and doesn't need to attempt saving throws against it. When the toxicant next uses her toxic secretion on a creature that attacks her with a natural or unarmed attack, she can expose the attacker to the digested poison (with that poison's normal duration, effects, and save DC) rather than her normal toxic secretion, even if the digested poison isn't normally a contact poison. The alchemist can maintain only a single digested poison at a time. If she digests a new poison, any older digested poison is lost. This ability replaces persistent mutagen."

As a fullround action, a trap breaker may expend one of his bombs to make a ranged touch attack against a trap, using the trap's Disable Device DC as its AC. If the attack misses, the bomb's splash damage activates the trap. If the attack hits, the bomb deactivates the trap without setting it off. The trap breaker must both know the location of the trap and be able to reach the trap's trigger with a ranged touch attack in order to use this ability. At 8th level, a trap breaker can disarm magic traps with this ability. This ability replaces poison resistance +4 and poison resistance +6.",

The land mine fills a single 5-foot square, and can't be placed in the same space as another trap, land mine, or magic trap. The trap breaker can arm the land mine with any bomb he is eligible to use, and the effects of this bomb are immediately transferred to the land mine. Creating a land mine uses up two of the alchemist's bombs per day. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the land mine, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid its effects are equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier. All alchemist land mines are mechanical traps with the qualities Trigger : location and Reset : none. Land mines last for 1 day per alchemist level or until they are triggered, whichever comes first.

Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the crushing despair and symbol effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters. They can treat this location as very familiar for the purpose of teleport and similar spells and can use scrying and related spells as though they were familiar with any subject within 20 feet of it.

Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains. Outsider Servant : This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day.

In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes. This ability replaces unholy champion. Ex-Insinuators An insinuator who willfully commits self less acts or engages in violence that doesn't further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can't progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the atonement spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again."

These antipaladins' armor is an outward symbol of their inner power, and they are rarely seen without it. Iron tyrants seek the strength to rule over domains as unfettered despots, and depend on their armor as protection against those they have not yet cowed. Most iron tyrants are orcs or Half-Orcs who worship the orc deities Lanishra (god of slavery, subjugation, and tyranny) or Varg (god of iron, siege weapons, and warfare) . Though rarer, some iron tyrants belong to other races and worship Urazra (giant god of battle, brutality, and strength) or demon lords such as Aldinach (She of the Six Venoms) , Angazhan (the Ravenous King) , or Izyagna (She of the Sevenfold Swarm)",

        "fiendish bond (su)": " At 5th level, instead of forming a fiendish bond with his weapon or a servant, an iron tyrant can form a bond with his armor. As a standard action, an iron tyrant can enhance his armor by calling upon a fiendish spirit's aid. This bond lasts for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed unholy light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 antipaladin levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: dastard , ghost touch , fortification (heavy, light, or medium) , invulnerability , spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19) . Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier. In addition, the iron tyrant can grant his armor the unrighteous special ability at the cost of a +4 bonus. These special abilities are added to any special abilities the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the iron tyrant, but it resumes giving bonuses if the iron tyrant dons the armor again. An iron tyrant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of bonded armor with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the iron tyrant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the iron tyrant takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This ability replaces fiendish boon."

These spellcasters retain many of the Magaambya's techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the Magaambya's staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone's tastes. For the teachers of the Magaambya, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil. Because they hold the Magaambya's interests close to their hearts but are not hindered by the need to remain close at hand to study or serve as teachers or assistants, Magaambyan initiates often serve as strong supporters beyond the normal reach of the Magaambya.

In the wilds where giants hunt, cleverness isn't the only thing the people need to survive-they require the fearlessness to confront a challenge, no matter the size. Elders select the children of the tribe's fiercest barbarians for the honor of becoming giant stalkers. Through intense training, these children learn to spot and track giants using telltale signs along with more subtle clues (such as giants' unique scents). They learn the giants' speech and culture; they study their traditions and brutality; and most importantly, they foster their hatred of these oversized foes. When Mammoth Lord followings travel, giant stalkers scout ahead, securing safe passage through giant-infested territories.

A targeted giant must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the giant stalker's barbarian level + the giant stalker's Constitution modifier) or be compelled to focus its attacks on the giant stalker; this ability can also affect non-giant creatures that are Large or larger, though such creatures gain a +4 bonus on the Will save to resist the effect. This compulsion ends if the giant stalker is out of sight or inaccessible to the giant's attacks. While baited, a giant is distracted and enraged by the insults-a giant stalker gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC against any giant she has successfully baited. Once baited, a giant remains baited for a number of rounds equal to the giant stalker's Constitution modifier, or until the giant stalker's rage ends (whichever comes first). If the giant stalker baits a different giant, any previously baited giant is no longer baited.

Perhaps owing to the strong ties between the organization's leadership and the Kintargo Opera House, the Silver Ravens are particularly active in the theater community and count many of Cheliax's finest singers among their recruits. In part, this is mere shrewdness, as actors and performers are often invited into the halls of the wealthy and powerful, where a rebellion can do the most damage. However, there is another reason for the Silver Ravens to recruit singers from the Chelish opera. The Silver Ravens rely on talented voices to deploy their most powerful weapon in the defense of Kintargo-the 'Song of Silver.' While specially trained argent dramaturges can create lesser versions of this song, the true 'Song of Silver' must be performed in Kintargo. Those among the Silver Ravens who dedicate themselves to the study of this magical performance are known as argent voices, and through practice and experience, these bards are able to modulate their own bardic performance abilities to reflect some measure of the power found in the 'Song of Silver.' For this reason, argent voices are among the most respected and treasured of the Silver Raven's agents. While some argent voices travel the Inner Sea, fighting tyranny and oppression, many others remain in Kintargo, ready to activate the city's defenses should the need arise.

Brazen deceivers' techniques come from a dark source. During the reformation of the Council, Sabriune and Aspexia acquired the shattered fragments of an ancient relic called the Totemrix , which belonged to the long-deceased demon lord of shadows, Vyriavaxus. This particularly intrigued Sabriune, for it was her demonic patron Nocticula who slew Vyriavaxus. Drawing upon Sabriune's heretical faith, Aspexia's psychometric mastery, and Westcrown's lingering psychic trauma from an oppressive shadow curse that plagued its nights for many years, the Council leaders were able to coax remnants of power from the broken artifact.

Maintaining a stunt is a free action, but it ends immediately if the busker is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. This ability is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and other effects that affect bardic performance. Like a bardic performance, a busker stunt cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities. Quick Hands (Su) : At 1st level as a swift action, a busker can call on his stunts to gain a +1 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks, a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and a +1 bonus on attack rolls as if from haste .

On a failed save, the target must answer one yes/no question the busker asks to the best of its ability. Anyone observing this (including the creature asked, even if it succeeds at its save) must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the busker's Bluff check) to realize the question was asked or answered. A target that feels threatened or is in combat is immune to this ability. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting enchantment effect. Living Statue (Su) : At 3rd level, a busker can use this stunt to hold perfectly still. While maintaining this stunt the busker can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by all observers' Sense Motive checks) to appear paralyzed, dead, or as a statue (this requires that the busker be disguised to look as though he were made of stone or metal, which is aided with a statue disguise kit ). Even magical means of determining the true nature of the busker do not function for an observer that fails this check. If the busker takes any physical actions, this stunt ends. Fascinate (Su) : At 6th level, the busker can fascinate creatures with his stunts, as per the bardic performance ability. Suggestion (Sp) : At 8th level, the busker can implant a suggestion in a creature with his stunts, as per the bardic performance ability of the same name.

While maintaining this stunt, the busker can use a thrown weapon (even an improvised one) to threaten spaces as though he were using a reach weapon. At 12th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the busker threatens squares up to 10 feet farther away with thrown weapons. Impossible Sleight of Hand (Su) : At 15th level, a busker can store items in or retrieve them from a personal extradimensional space with a maximum capacity of 8,000 cubic feet and 8,000 pounds as a busker stunt. The item may be sent from or called to his hand or any place it fits on his person. He can access the extradimensional space only to store or retrieve a single object at a time; to retrieve or store an object larger than Fine size, the busker must expend 1 additional round of busker stunts for each size category larger than Fine.

Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). The bard selects a number of targets equal to his level, who must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) or be affected by rage for a number of rounds equal to the bard's level. The bard indicates who is the intended target of violence (either after using this ability or as part of the performance leading to it) and the enraged members of the crowd immediately attack the target if possible. The target does not need to be present ('kill the king' is a suitable choice) and can be an object instead of a person ('destroy the prison!' is likewise appropriate).

This ability replaces suggestion. Righteous Cause (Ex) : At 18th level, the demagogue can lift a crowd's emotions and turn them toward a common purpose. First, he must fascinate the crowd, and then use incite violence without designating a target, at which point he can use righteous cause. Instead of driving the crowd with anger, he fills them with purpose. Fascinated creatures must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to resist.

This ability functions exactly as per memorize page , but the impervious messenger is the only recipient and he requires only 1 round to commit a single page to memory. An impervious messenger can commit additional pages worth of material to memory by using additional rounds of his bardic performance, but he can never memorize more than half his total bard level in pages (minimum 1). This ability replaces fascinate. Song of Subterfuge (Su) : At 6th level, an impervious messenger learns to use his performances to project various thoughts into his own mind to disrupt divination attempts. This acts similarly to distraction, except it only affects the impervious messenger and allows him to use the result of his Perform check in place of saving throws against attempts to read his mind, such as detect thoughts. At 18th level, if the impervious messenger succeeds on a saving throw while using song of subterfuge, the character who attempted the divination effect must succeed on a Will save (DC = 20 + the impervious messenger's Charisma modifier) or else the impervious messenger instantly learns the nature of the effect and can allow the effect to continue, but provide whatever information he chooses to the divining character rather than the true results of the divination effect. This ability replaces suggestion and mass suggestion. Unbroken Stride (Su) : At 8th level, an impervious messenger draws upon his bardic abilities to imbue himself with grace and speed. While using this bardic performance, an impervious messenger gains an insight bonus equal to half his bard level on all Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, and Ride checks. In addition, while maintaining this performance, he gains the benefits of the ranger's woodland stride ability and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base land speed.

An enrapturing performance is exactly like a bardic performance with the following exceptions. A lotus geisha can use an enrapturing performance to recreate the effects of any of her known bardic performances, but she focuses the performance on only a single target within range. While other creatures see and hear a lotus geisha's enrapturing performance, only the target of this ability is affected by it. A lotus geisha cannot have a bardic performance and an enrapturing performance in effect at the same time. Every round spent engaged in an enrapturing performance counts against the total number of rounds per day she can use her bardic performance, and she cannot use this ability if she does not have any more rounds of bardic performance left for that day. Starting an enrapturing performance is a standard action; at 7th level, it becomes a move action, and at 13th level, it becomes a swift action. A lotus geisha adds a +2 bonus to the DC of Will saves made to resist the effects of her fascinate, frightening tune, and suggestion enrapturing performances. When a lotus geisha uses her enrapturing performance ability to emulate inspire competence, inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics, any bonuses to AC or on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks increase by +1. For example, a lotus geisha using inspire heroics as an enrapturing performance would grant her target a +5 morale bonus on saving throws and a +5 dodge bonus to AC, instead of the usual +4 bonuses. This ability replaces well-versed.",

Charming Melody (Su) While using the fascinate bardic performance, the luring piper can play a song that compels animals and fey to follow him wherever he goes. Instead of sitting peacefully and merely observing the luring piper, creatures with the animal or fey type instead quietly and calmly walk toward the luring piper, stopping once they are adjacent to the luring piper and following him if he moves. This performance modifies fascinate. Deadly Lure (Sp) At 8th level, the luring piper can use his suggestion bardic performance on targeted animals and fey to make them take actions that result in their own injury or death, such as leaping off a cliff or into a river. The targeted creature is allowed a second saving throw to shake off the effect before completing any self-harming actions. This performance replaces the bard's dirge of doom. Fey-Wounding Song (Sp) At 12th level as a full-round action, the luring piper can expend 3 rounds of bardic performance to play a song that causes fey tremendous pain. Treat this as equivalent to mass inflict serious wounds , but affecting only fey targets and using the lurid piper's bard level as his caster level. This performance replaces soothing performance.",

While performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt to counter any spell that he can identify using Spellcraft, so long as that spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has been performing spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is made as if using dispel magic , using the bard's level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic performance immediately ends.

Seamless Guise (Ex) : At 1st level, a masked performer learns to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for her current role, on stage or off. She can maintain this performance for 1 hour for every 3 rounds of bardic performance she spends. While this performance is active, she receives a +10 bonus on Disguise and Perform (act) checks to remain in character after she has already established her character. For instance, this bonus does not apply against the initial Perception check when meeting a creature paying attention to her but does apply on the automatic additional Perception check each hour of interacting. This ability replaces countersong. Exaggerated Pose (Su) : At 3rd level, a masked performer can enhance her own physical and social abilities by simply altering her posture. When she starts this performance, the masked performer chooses a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Charisma-based skill and gains a +2 competence bonus on checks with that skill as long as she maintains this performance.

Stage Combat (Su) : At 6th level, a masked performer gains the benefit of a combat feat she doesn't have as long as she maintains this performance. The masked performer chooses the feat when she starts this performance. The masked performer must meet all the feat's prerequisites. As usual when temporarily gaining a feat, if the feat she chooses has any limitations on uses, such as Stunning Fist 's daily uses, all uses of that combat feat while maintaining stage combat count toward that feat's limit. In the case of Stunning Fist, if the masked performer gained that feat again later the same day, the expended uses would remain expended. Stage combat relies on visual components. This ability replaces suggestion. Multiplicity of Masks (Su) : At 18th level, a masked performer can cause any number of her allies to appear as herself or as another ally within 60 feet. To be affected, an ally must be within 60 feet of the masker performer and able to see her. As long as the masked performer maintains this performance, enemies perceive all affected allies as the chosen character. If an affected ally is a different size or creature type than the chosen character, enemies can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the masked performer's bard level + her Charisma modifier) to disbelieve. Otherwise, there is no saving throw, but a successful attack against a disguised ally automatically reveals the ally's true form. If an ally moves out of range, that ally reverts to his original form, and the entire effect ends if the ally providing his appearance to the others moves out of range.

        "bardic performance": "  A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below. Mock (Su) : At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate. Punchline (Sp) : At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability. Mass Punchline (Sp) : This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.",

This functions as the steal combat maneuver, but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first).

Upon concluding the plan, the ringleader chooses one of her bardic performances and expends a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to up to double her bard level. Thereafter, as a move action, the ringleader or any of the instructed allies can trigger the implanted instructions, causing that creature to immediately gain the benefits of the ringleader's implanted bardic performance (each creature can trigger the instructions for itself separately). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the rounds of bardic performance the ringleader expended while creating the plan, though the effect also ends if the ringleader dismisses it as a free action or activates a different plan or bardic performance. For the purpose of this ability, the ringleader attempts any skill checks associated with the bardic performance once a creature triggers the plan. A ringleader's cunning plans all expire each time she regains her daily spell slots or after 24 hours (whichever comes first). At 7th level, the ringleader (but not an ally) can trigger a cunning plan as a swift action instead of as a move action. At 13th level, the ringleader can trigger a cunning plan as an immediate action. A ringleader is less capable of improvising, and when she uses bardic performance without creating a cunning plan, she must expend 1 additional round of bardic performance to begin the performance.

At 8th level, the ringleader's ally gains a competence bonus on an additional skill (for a total of two skills). In addition, he can end the effect to reroll a check with one of the affected skills (the reroll still applies the bonus from inspire competence). Each ally can only use this latter ability once per day, regardless of the number of skills affected and the number of times they are affected by inspire competence. At 14th level, the ringleader's ally gains a competence bonus on an additional skill (for a total of three skills). In addition, he can take 10 on the affected skills when stressed or distracted. This ability alters inspire competence and replaces dirge of doom and frightening tune.",
        "inspired plan (su)": " At 2nd level, a ringleader can alter his performance so it affects a single ally at a later time. The ringleader must explain his plan to that ally for a number of minutes equal to the number of bardic performance rounds he expends on the effect, and use audible and/or visual components according to the performance altered. This costs the ringleader the chosen number of rounds of bardic performance. At any time before the ringleader recovers bardic performance rounds for the day, the inspired character can activate the performance as a standard action wherever she is. When activated, the altered performance affects only the inspired ally and has no audible or visible components. If the performance could normally affect any number of allies, its effects last 2 rounds for each round the ringleader spent on the performance. Otherwise, the effects last 1 round for each round the ringleader spent on the performance. A ringleader can alter only the countersong, distraction, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics performances in this way. The ringleader makes any necessary choices when establishing the performance, though in the case of countersong and distraction, the ringleader attempts Perform checks once his ally triggers the plan, ignoring any temporary bonuses or penalties, no matter whether they applied when he explained the plan or when the ally triggers it. A character can be subject to only one inspired plan at a time and cannot be subject to a ringleader's inspired plan and any of the ringleader's normal performances at the same time, but she can benefit from other bardic performances in the interim. The ringleader cannot use inspired plan on himself, but he can have dormant plans ready to trigger on as many different allies as he can afford to affect at once.

When the ringleader is in a situation where he could use a particular piece of nonmagical gear, the ringleader can attempt a Knowledge check appropriate to his current situation to have purchased that item in advance. The DC of the check is equal to the item's cost in gp. If he succeeds, he deducts the appropriate cost of the item from his current gp total and now has the item in question on his person. He cannot use this ability to retroactively gain an item that would change his encumbrance to a different load category, though in this case, he can attempt to retrieve such objects from a pack mule, extradimensional storage space, or other location that would not affect his encumbrance.

        "bardic performance": "  A sandman gains the following types of bardic performance. Stealspell (Su) : A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage. Slumber Song (Sp) : At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as deep slumber , but with no HD limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion. This performance replaces suggestion. Dramatic Subtext (Su) : At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components while retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers must succeed at a Perception check opposed by a sandman's Sleight of Hand check to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance ends. This ability replaces inspire greatness. Greater Stealspell (Su) : A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its owner. This performance replaces inspire heroics. Mass Slumber Song (Sp) : At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like mass suggestion . This performance replaces mass suggestion Spell Catching (Su) : At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's level, even if the check fails. This performance replaces deadly performance.",

He gains temporary hit points equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive), and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next attack roll prior to the start of his next turn. These temporary hit points remain until the bard ends his performance. This performance replaces fascinate. Incite Rage (Su) : At 6th level, a savage skald can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as a rage spell that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance; however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot target himself with this ability.

The watersinger can command the water to take various forms, bend, rise, fall, or sustain a shape, and can make it support weight as if it were solid ice. For example, the watersinger could create a pillar of water (to provide cover), ladder, channel, bridge, stairs, slide, and so on. The manipulated water is as slippery as normal ice.

Waterstrike (Su) : At 3rd level, the watersinger can spend 1 round of bardic performance to command any water he is currently manipulating with his watersong performance to lash out and strike an opponent with a slam attack. The watersinger uses his base attack bonus and Charisma bonus to make this attack, and deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage plus his Charisma bonus.

At 14th level, a target who takes damage from cutting remark must also succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wit's bard level + his Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the dazing effect of the wit's cutting remark for 24 hours.

For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits. These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature list or the expanded summoning list (see the summoning project ) that are appropriate for the spell level.

In many cases, when an enlightened bloodrager encounters a more traditional bloodrager, the meeting is laced with tension and suspicion. The enlightened bloodrager is, of course, well aware of the other bloodrager's tendency toward violence, and the other bloodrager is often unnerved by the calm and reasoned mannerisms of his enlightened counterpart.

Only with the arrival of Ancil Alkenstar in 4588 AR did Dongun Hold reopen itself to the outside world.

If dropped or taken, the weapon ceases granting this ability until it is returned to the symbol striker. The symbol striker can have only a single weapon rune active at a time; if he casts an additional weapon rune while a previous rune is active, the earlier rune fades. Weapon runes also fade when the symbol striker regains his spell slots for the day. Otherwise, the rune remains until the spell is discharged or dispelled.

This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, which is decided at the rune's creation. The rune is clearly visible and lasts a number of minutes equal to the symbol striker's bloodrager level or until discharged. A symbol striker cannot create a rune trap in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling.

The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer's movement takes her out of the triggering attack's reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks.

Removing or reattaching the constructed limb takes 10 minutes. The constructed pugilist can improve her constructed limb as if it were a normal melee weapon. For the purpose of rebuilding the limb as a masterwork weapon, rebuilding the limb out of a special material, or adding certain magical special abilities to it, the limb counts as a one-handed melee weapon that costs 60 gp and weighs 6 pounds-though it is specially fitted to the constructed pugilist and can't be resold or used by anyone else.

Flex Limb : The limb is divided into jointed segments held in place with rigid rods. As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can release the rods and turn her limb into a whiplike appendage. In this mode, the prosthesis can be used to make trip attempts, and it grants a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made using it. The constructed pugilist doesn't run the risk of dropping her limb if she fails. Returning the limb to its rigid form takes a standard action. As a standard action, a constructed pugilist with both flex limb and limb extender can activate or deactivate one of those limb modifications or both simultaneously; when the constructed pugilist has both flex limb and limb extender activated, she gains the benefits of reach with the flex limb abilities. Grapnel Arm : The constructed pugilist can fire a grappling hook built into her prosthesis. The grappling hook is attached to a 40-foot-long fine chain affixed to the limb. The constructed pugilist can attack with the grappling hook as a standard action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. The grappling hook can't be used as part of a full attack. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but it functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22), except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit) and the grapple ends if the constructed pugilist moves more than 40 feet away from the grappled creature. The constructed limb can't be used to make melee attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (a standard action). Limb Extender : As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can activate an extender, giving her limb the reach weapon special feature. Returning the limb to its normal length is a standard action. Shielding Limb : The constructed pugilist learns to block blows with her mechanical limb. She gains a +2 shield bonus to AC, though she loses this bonus anytime she loses her Dexterity bonus to AC. Tight Grip : Special tensors allow the constructed pugilist to lock her grip in place. When using her constructed limb, the constructed pugilist gains a +1 bonus on Climb checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm and grapple, as well as to her CMD against attempts to disarm items held in the limb. This modification can be chosen only if the limb includes a hand or other gripping appendage. Vicious Blades : Razor-sharp blades on the surface of the limb cause it to deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19-20. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious spikes limb modification can't select this modification. Vicious Spikes : Long spikes protrude from the limb, causing it to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and increasing its critical multiplier to  x3. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious blades limb modification can't select this modification.",

The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion's attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic's adhesive . The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability. If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike ) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry. At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield's damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.

If she hits with her first unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the venomfist's brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist's Constitution modifier. The venomfist is immune to this toxin. At 4th level, a target that fails this save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple doses of a venomfist's poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces the older one. At 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued, shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom or until the venom's duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the attack still deals the extra damage. At 10th level, when the venomfist chooses the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom. At 16th level, the venomfist's venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist's poison for 24 hours. In addition, the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom. This is a poison effect. The venomfist can't suppress it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those she merely touches).

At 6th level, a castellan gains evasion (as a rogue) when he has cover (but not soft cover) against the source of the attack. At 11th level, these bonuses increase by 1. At 16th level, he gains improved evasion instead of evasion. Both the evasion and improved evasion abilities work even when the castellan wears medium or heavy armor. This ability replaces mount.",
        "castle lore": "  At 3rd level, the castellan gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Perception, and Stealth checks when he is in urban terrain, including fortifications. A castellan in an urban environment can always act in a surprise round, though he remains flat-footed until he acts. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the castellan's bonuses on skill and initiative checks increase by 2. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.",
        "guard companion": "  At 4th level, the castellan forms a bond with an animal companion that serves as a guard. While most castellans select birds or canines, the castellan can choose any animal companions available to rangers .

This ability replaces expert trainer.",
        "mighty defense": "  At 11th level, when the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, he doubles the threat range of any melee weapons wielded during the attack. This increase doesn't stack with other effects that increase the threat range of his weapons. In addition, the cavalier can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his readied attack is successful. This free combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces mighty charge.",

        "supreme defense": "  At 20th level, whenever the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, his readied attack deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple the damage if using a brace weapon against a charge). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on the readied attack, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + the cavalier's class level + the cavalier's Strength modifier) reduces this to being staggered for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces supreme charge."

Because of his equine form, a charger can wield a lance one-handed as if mounted and deals double damage with a lance while charging. A charger can never gain the benefit of the Mounted Combat feat (or other similar feats or effects, such as Trick Riding ) if ridden by another creature. This ability replaces mount.",

This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. Whenever he performs a charge, the charger can make an additional hoof attack against his target with a -5 penalty on his attack roll. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.",
        "courser (ex)": "  At 4th level, a charger's constant training increases his land speed by 10 feet. A charger can also move through up to 10 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. These benefits apply only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the charger's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger's land speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain. This ability replaces expert trainer.",

For each successful overrun combat maneuver check, the charger automatically deals an amount of damage to the overrun target equal to that of his hoof attack and can continue with his charge. If any overrun attempt fails during the charge, the charger's progress ends in the space directly in front of the target where the maneuver failed. These overrun attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. For each target in the path of his charge, the charger incurs a cumulative -2 penalty on his overrun combat maneuver checks.

Whenever she advances in level, the range within which she gains this bonus expands by another 25 miles-50 miles at 2nd level, 75 miles at 3rd level, and so forth. This bonus on Intimidate checks increases by 2 when she enters a community within this area that she hasn't visited for 1 week or more. At 9th level and 17th level, the circuit judge can select another community within the range in which she gains this ability's bonus. She can measure from that community (as well as previous communities) to determine whether she gains this ability's bonus on the relevant skill checks. This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.",
        "sentence (ex)": " Once per day as a swift action, the circuit judge can choose one target within sight to sentence. The circuit judge gains the potential for a variety of bonuses related to that target. The circuit judge chooses the form of these benefits from the following list of inquisitor judgments : destruction, justice, protection, purity, or smiting. The benefits of these judgments apply only to the circuit judge and the target-the protection judgment's bonus to Armor Class, for example, applies only to attacks made by the sentenced target (not any creature who attacks the circuit judge while the judgment is active). Treat the circuit judge's level as her inquisitor level for the purposes of determining how these judgments increase in power. The circuit judge can use this ability twice per day at 1st level, plus two additional times per day for every 3 cavalier levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 14 times per day at 19th level. She can switch her sentence as a swift action, but doing so expends an additional daily use of this ability. Sentencing a foe requires much of the circuit judge's concentration. The circuit judge takes a -2 penalty to her Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of her sentence. The sentence remains in effect either until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Sentences are considered challenges for the purposes of the effects listed in the challenge section describing the cavalier's order. This ability replaces challenge.",

        "instant order (ex)": "  At 11th level, a constable can bark an order to an ally within 30 feet as a standard action. That ally can instantly take a single move or standard action to comply with the order. Taking the action dazes the ally for 1 round afterward. At 20th level, the constable can use this ability as a move action, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces mighty charge and supreme charge.",

A courtly knight starts any verbal duel with an extra edge she can use for only the presence tactic unless she is at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. This ability replaces tactician.",
        "imperious attitude (ex)": " At 9th level, a courtly knight develops a commanding demeanor, and the strength of her conviction is often enough to get others to do as she asks, merely because she expects it to be done. In a social setting, the courtly knight can attempt Diplomacy checks to make a request of a creature whose attitude toward her is unfriendly, provided that creature does not intend to harm or oppose the courtly knight or her allies in the immediate future. Further, whenever she attempts a Diplomacy check to make a request, a courtly knight can first attempt an Intimidate check (DC = 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier). If she succeeds, she gains a +5 bonus on the subsequent Diplomacy check. Neither aspect of imperious attitude applies if the requested creature considers itself to be of an equal or higher social rank than the courtly knight, which includes creatures that don't understand or value the concept of social ranks. This ability replaces greater tactician.",

She does not gain the benefits of her challenge (including any additional benefits granted by her order) when making a grand boast. If she successfully defeats the target of her challenge within 1 minute, however, she is vindicated in her boast and gains the benefits of her challenge against all allies of the defeated enemy who witnessed her grand boast and who are of the same or lower CR as the defeated enemy.

      "Daring General": {
        "source": "Ultimate Intrigue pg. 24 Most cavaliers are great tacticians, but some stand above the rest for their ability to lead troops under their command, and inspire them to great accomplishments. Those cavaliers most gifted at command often become daring generals.",
        "aides-de-camp (ex)": " A daring general gains a modified version of the Leadership feat at 6th level, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. All followers that the daring general gains as a result of this version of the Leadership feat can only have levels in the warrior class. All cohorts that the daring general gains from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full base attack bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must be at least 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th level and 18th level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to a maximum of three cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers equal to the number of followers he gained from the Leadership feat (up to a maximum of triple his normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a -3 penalty for the second cohort and a -6 penalty for the third cohort). Additionally, the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below. Unless otherwise stated, only one cohort can fill any given role at any given time. Designating a cohort as filling a special role requires a 24-hour ceremonial ritual. Groom : The groom cares for the daring general's mount. She does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding the cavalier's mount. Additionally, once per day, the groom can spend 10 minutes preparing the daring general's mount for battle. If she does, the mount's speed increases by 10 feet and its Dexterity score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour. Squire : The squire's main task is to care for the daring general's arms and armor. If the squire aids the daring general in donning his armor, it takes half as much time to don as it would if someone else aided the daring general. Additionally, when the squire is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard action, she can grant a +2 bonus to the daring general's AC against the first attack made against the daring general before the squire's next turn. This counts as an application of the aid another action, but the squire does not need to threaten the attacker in question. Standard Bearer : The daring general's standard bearer can carry his banner in his stead, granting the benefits of his banner ability (and later, his greater banner ability) to all allies within 60 feet of the standard bearer. If the standard bearer becomes unconscious or dead, she ceases to grant these benefits. Beyond the rules noted above, if the daring general uses his followers to create an army using the mass combat rules, that army starts with one extra tactic of the daring general's choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score. The daring general can assign each of his followers individually to serve as either footmen or honor guards (described below). He does not need to assign either role to a given follower, if he prefers. He can change the role of a follower at any time, but it takes 1 day per level for the follower to change her tactics to suit her new role. Followers with a particular role must group together with other followers with the same role to form an army in mass combat. Footman : Each follower gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a -2 penalty to her AC and on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and takes a -2 penalty to its DV in mass combat. Honor Guard : The follower gains a +2 bonus to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. An honor guard unit gains a +2 bonus to its DV and takes a -2 penalty to its OM in mass combat. This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.",

When selecting skills with social grace, he must choose from the following list: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography, history, local, or nobility), Perform, Profession (soldier), or Sense Motive.

This spectral companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion , using the ghost rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). The ghost rider's ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities.

The luring cavalier is a special type of cavalier that helps accomplish that goal. Typically, he uses a bow or other ranged weapon to lure opponents toward him, and then makes strategic retreats to position his enemies exactly where he wants them.",
        "far challenge (ex)": "  Once per day, a luring cavalier can use his far challenge ability as a swift action. When he does, the luring cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The luring cavalier's ranged attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the luring cavalier's level. The luring cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. Furthermore, once per day, the luring cavalier may spend a use of his far challenge ability to double the potential extra damage of his ranged attack. Before making the attack roll, he can choose to spend a use of his challenge to deal twice his cavalier level in extra damage on a successful hit instead of just his cavalier level in extra damage. If the attack misses, the use of the challenge is wasted. Challenging a foe requires subtle deceits and strategies. The cavalier must make it look like he is a soft target. The subject of the far challenge gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls made against him. This challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious, until the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, or until the combat ends. If this challenge ends because the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, this challenge changes to the effects of the normal cavalier challenge, and gains any order benefit the luring cavalier has. Far challenge replaces the challenge ability.",
        "careful aim (ex)": "  At 3rd level, when a luring cavalier makes a ranged attack with his highest base attack bonus, he can ignore the penalties for firing up to three range increments away. If he is using a firearm, he can target touch AC up to two range increments away. This effect stacks with effects that allow the cavalier to make ranged attacks farther without penalty or that allow him to target touch AC with a firearm beyond the first range increment. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.",

While infuriated, the target must spend its turn moving closer to the cavalier, making move, run, or charge actions only (challenged creature's choice). This is a mind-affecting effect. This ability replaces mighty charge.",

This weapon is both a symbol of the cavalier's duty and a focus for much of his talent. He cannot sell this weapon. He also gains the Gunsmithing feat. Beginning at 8th level, the musketeer can focus himself when wielding his gifted weapon. As a standard action, he can focus himself to gain a number of benefits for 1 minute per cavalier level. The musketeer can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level. At 8th level, the cavalier gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. At 11th level, he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1), and at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon. The reduction of the weapon's misfire chance and the doubled range increment abilities don't stack with the similar benefits of the reliable and distance magic weapon special abilities. Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough bullets to complete each attack. If the musketeer's gifted firearm is destroyed, the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a -1 penalty on weapon and damage rolls. This ability replaces the standard cavalier's mount ability.",

A verdivant can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 cavalier levels he has beyond 2nd. A verdivant can apply effloresces to himself, or his plant mount if it is adjacent. Efflorescences last for 1 round per cavalier level, and a verdivant can have at most two efflorescences in effect at a time. A verdivant can end an efflorescence during his turn as a free action. At 6th level, a verdivant can effloresce as a move action. At 12th level, a verdivant can effloresce as a swift action, and he can have two efflorescences in effect simultaneously. At 17th level, a verdivant can effloresce twice as part of the same action. At 2nd level, a verdivant can use the following efflorescences. Shieldvines (Ex) : Allies within 10 feet do not provoke attacks of opportunity when leaving threatened squares; this increases to 20 feet at 9th level. Floatflower (Ex) : Allies within 10 feet ignore the effects of nonmagical difficult terrain. At 9th level, they also gain the effects of air walk while within 10 feet of the verdivant. At 5th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences. Innervating Pollen (Ex) : The verdivant and his allies within 30 feet gain a competence bonus either on attack rolls or to saving throws (the verdivant's choice; all allies gain the same benefit) equal to one-third the verdivant's cavalier level. Bolsterbloom (Su) : The verdivant and his allies within 30 feet gain fast healing 1; this fast healing increases by 1 at 9th level, and again at 14th and 17th levels. At 9th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences. Charged Blossoms (Su) : Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The verdivant and his allies within 10 feet gain energy resistance 10 to the chosen energy type. At 14th level this affects allies within 20 feet, and the energy resistance increases to 20. Slipstrands (Su) : The verdivant and his allies within 10 feet are affected by freedom of movement ; this increases to 20 feet at 17th level. At 14th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences. Ambrosia (Su) : The efflorescence temporarily suppresses enchantments, transmutations, and curses on the verdivant and his allies within 30 feet, as break enchantment with a caster level equal to the verdivant's cavalier level. Affected creatures ignore the effects of such conditions for the duration of the efflorescence, after which the conditions' full effects resume. The duration of suppressed conditions continues to elapse while the condition is suppressed. Luckleaf (Su) : When attempting a d20 roll, allies of the verdivant within 30 feet of him can roll twice and use the better result; each ally can benefit from this ability only once per efflorescence. Luckleaf can be activated once per minute. This replaces tactician, banner, greater tactician, greater banner, master tactician, and bonus feats.",

Blossoming lights are primarily found among the Lantern Bearers, as their powers are a great boon against the organization's foes. Despite this, their ways did not originate with elvenkind. Legend tells that Sarenrae, horrified by the consequences of the destruction of Gormuz, reached out to one of that city's survivors. She granted the frightened woman divine powers to guide her fellow survivors, both to safety and to goodness, and humbly asked her to spread the message of redemption and forgiveness. While this priestess's identity has been lost to history, the Dawnflower's imparted wisdom has not. Within the Lantern Bearers, given their growing alliance with Sarenrae's faith, the traditions of the blossoming light have found the perfect place to flourish.

Among these, an even smaller number find that while their original deity no longer answers their prayers, something else does: an unknown entity or force of the universe channeling its power through a trained and practicing vessel. This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-cleric. EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES The following archetype can be taken by an ex-cleric immediately upon becoming an ex-cleric, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-cleric replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Channelers of the unknown can gain further levels in the cleric class, even though becoming an ex-cleric normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an atonement spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path.

Creatures that take damage from the channeled demonic energy receive a Fortitude save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the demonic apostle's level + the demonic apostle's Charisma modifier. Lawful good creatures take a -2 penalty on this saving throw. At 5th level, chaotic evil allies within the burst are affected as if targeted by a rage spell with a duration of 1 round. At 9th level, lawful or good enemies are also sickened for 1d6 rounds if they fail their saving throw against the demonic channel. Channeling demonic energy is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces channel energy."

They might see themselves as an incarnation of their deity in the flesh, or they could simply seek to embody the physical and spiritual ideals set forth by their deity. Many divine paragons go as far as to alter their appearance, as best as possible, to look similar to their chosen deity, but such a level of devotion is not required by the archetype.",

She gains Deific Obedience ISG as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the feat's prerequisites. She gains access to her boons at an accelerated rate (see below) rather than the standard HD-based rate granted by Deific Obedience (and as such cannot benefit from the accelerated rate granted by the Diverse Obedience feat). When the divine paragon selects her domains, she must designate one of the two domains she gains as her devoted domain. She gains all of this domain's granted powers and domain spells normally. For her other domain, she gains only its domain spells-she does not gain any of the granted powers of that domain. Instead, she must choose from the evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons granted by her deity (as detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods ). At 5th level, she gains access to the first boon granted by her deity. At 11th level, she gains access to the second boon. At 14th level, she gains access to the third boon. In order to retain access to her domain spells, the domain powers of her devoted domain, and the boons granted by Deific Obedience, the divine paragon must perform her obedience daily. If she fails to do so, she loses access to these abilities until she next performs her obedience (but she can still cast spells, channel energy, and perform other abilities granted by her cleric levels). This ability alters domains.",

The mark's location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the deity's holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine paragon's aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric's as a result of her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect good.

The divine scourge uses her Wisdom modifier instead of her Intelligence modifier to determine the save DCs of her hexes.

A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus (depending on whether the ecclesitheurge channels positive or negative energy) on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving throws or to AC until the ecclesitheurge's next turn.

An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from his primary domain's spell list. Each day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge can select a different domain granted by his deity to gain access to that domain's spell list instead of his secondary domain spell list. He does not lose access to his actual secondary domain's granted powers or gain access to the other domain's granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge of Sarenrae with Glory as his primary domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list, but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the granted powers of the Healing domain. This ability alters the normal domain ability.",

As with a wizard's bonded item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous Item), provided he meets the feat's level prerequisites. For example, an ecclesitheurge with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like amulet of natural armor , to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function for only the ecclesitheurge. If a bonded holy symbol's owner dies or the item is replaced, the object loses all enhancements the ecclesitheurge added using this ability.

However, because of the fragile state of his mind, the Elder Mythos cultist takes a -2 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects. An Elder Mythos cultist automatically fails any save to resist the effects of confusion , insanity , and nightmare , and other similar effects so long as the effect's caster level is higher than his character level.",
        "channel the void (su)": " At 1st level, when an Elder Mythos cultist channels energy, he taps into the unthinkable void between the stars. This is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead, this blast of energy harms and devours living beings, corporeal non-skeletal undead, and constructs crafted from flesh (such as flesh golems). This is not negative energy damage; instead, the damage manifests in the form of wounds from supernatural deterioration and rot. A creature that would take damage from this energy can attempt a Fortitude save to halve the damage, rather than a Will save. At 8th level, a creature that both fails the Fortitude save and would be killed or destroyed by this effect is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. This ability still counts as channel energy, but it counts as neither positive nor negative energy specifically (for example, the Elder Mythos cultist couldn't take the Turn Undead or Command Undead feat). For the purposes of feats that require channel energy but refer to what happens if the character channels positive or negative energy, this ability alters the listed effect for negative energy. For instance, an Elder Mythos cultist could use  annel Smite to damage living or fleshy creatures with his melee attack. This ability alters channel energy and replaces spontaneous casting.",

A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Elder Mythos cultist's cleric level + his Charisma modifier) negates the Wisdom damage and the confusion effect, though the target is sickened for 1 round. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. An Elder Mythos cultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day for every 3 cleric levels thereafter. At 11th level, the target takes 1d6+1 points of Wisdom damage and is confused and sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the Wisdom damage to 1 point, and the target is instead sickened for 1d6 rounds. At 19th level, the target takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage and is rendered permanently confused and sickened. Only greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can remove the confused and sickened conditions. A successful Will save halves the Wisdom damage, and the target is instead sickened for 2d6 rounds. This ability replaces the increases to channel energy gained at 5th, 11th, and 19th levels."

This ability is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead and dealing damage to living creatures, this blast of evil energy automatically heals evil creatures and debilitates good creatures within its burst. Channeling this evil causes a burst that affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the fiendish vessel. In the case of evil creatures, the amount of damage healed is equal to 1d4 points of damage and increases by 1d4 at every two levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d4 at 19th level). Good creatures in the burst receive a Will saving throw to negate this damage. Good creatures that fail their saving throws are sickened for 1d4 rounds. Good creatures with a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to the fiendish vessel's class level - 5 that fail their saving throws are nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the fiendish vessel's level + the fiendish vessel's Charisma bonus. Neutral creatures are unaffected by this burst of evil energy. A fiendish vessel may channel this energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A fiendish vessel can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A fiendish vessel must present her unholy symbol or use her familiar as the divine focus for this ability. For the purposes of feats that affect channel energy, this ability counts as channeling negative energy. If the feat changes the way the fiendish vessel channels or deals damage with her channeling, use the amount of damage this ability heals evil creatures to determine the damage-dealing potential of the affected ability. For instance, if a 5th-level fiendish vessel takes the Channel Smite feat, her channeling deals an additional 3d4 points of damage to living creatures on a successful hit (though they may save to negate the damage). This ability replaces channel energy.",
        "fiendish familiar": "  At 3rd level, a fiendish vessel's patron rewards her with a fiendish servant. The fiendish vessel gains an imp, quasit, or cacodaemon familiar based on the patron she worships. This ability is identical to the wizard's arcane bond with a familiar and the Improved Familiar feat, using the fiendish vessel's character level in place of the wizard level. This tiny fiend acts like a perverse, manifest moral compass. Furthermore, this familiar can act as a living divine focus and unholy symbol for her spellcasting if the fiendish vessel so desires, which means that when she uses her channel evil ability, its burst can be centered on the familiar instead, as long as that familiar is within 30 feet and line of sight. A fiendish vessel's familiar tends to be fawning and subservient to the fiendish vessel. Should her familiar die, the fiendish vessel's patron replaces the familiar with an identical one within 1 week, without the need for a special ritual. Furthermore, the fiendish familiar gains the following special abilities beyond the standard familiar special abilities. Fiendish Augury (Sp) : At 3rd level, the fiendish vessel can ask the familiar whether a particular course of action will bring good or bad results for her in the immediate future. This ability acts like the augury spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level, with the familiar acting as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day. Fiendish Divination (Sp) : At 9th level, the fiendish vessel can use a more powerful form of divination to gain intelligence from her patron through her fiendish familiar. This ability acts like the divination spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level; the familiar acts as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.

Durability : The inscribed item's hardness increases by an amount equal to the forgemaster's Wisdom modifier, and its hit points increase by an amount equal to twice her level. Featherlight : The inscribed item's weight is halved; a metal item's weight is reduced to 1/4 normal.

      "Hidden Priest": {
        "source": "Inner Sea Magic pg. 35 Practicing one's religion is not always legal. For example, most lands outlaw worshiping fiends. Taldor has banned the faith of Sarenrae from being openly worshiped. Rahadoum flat-out forbids all religions within its borders. But as time has shown again and again, mere laws are poor deterrents to the worship of dedicated members of such faiths, whether the zealous wish to subvert authority, free the spirits of the oppressed, or merely enjoy the right to practice their beliefs. Clerics in these circumstances must conceal their true natures, practice their magic in secret, and always be on guard for betrayal and discovery. A hidden priest has the following class features.",
        "false arcanist (ex)": "  At 1st level, a hidden priest is able to disguise his cleric spellcasting, presenting it as arcane magic of some kind. Typically, this is as alchemist, bard, sorcerer, or wizard magic, and the cleric disguises the words and gestures of the cleric spell with accoutrements appropriate to his apparent profession. He must make a skill check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise his casting and successfully cast the spell. The type of skill check depends on the type of caster he pretends to be: Craft (alchemy) for alchemist, Perform for bard, Knowledge (arcana) for sorcerer or wizard. Using Spellcraft to identify the spell works normally, though unless the observer beats the DC by 10 or more, she doesn't suspect the source of the magic is divine. For example, a hidden priest pretending to be an alchemist wants to cast cure light wounds on a wounded townsperson. If he makes a DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check, he disguises his spellcasting as the mixing of an alchemical extract or potion (perhaps with the words disguised as reciting an obscure formula or talking herself through the list of ingredients), which he gives to the target. An observer making a DC 16 Spellcraft check can identify his spell as cure light wounds , but doesn't realize his 'alchemical' methods are a sham unless her check result is 26 or higher. When the hidden priest uses this ability, he must still provide any divine focus components for the spells he casts. However, the divine focus doesn't need to be an obvious symbol of his faith. It could be a small coin, tattoo, or garment bearing the symbol, whether presented openly, disguised, or hidden within a larger picture. For example, a hidden priest of Sarenrae may use a coin with an ankh or sunburst, a complex tattoo or scar that has an ankh shape hidden within it, a glove with an ankh stitched on the inside of the palm, and so on. He must use this replacement divine focus just as he would his true one (for example, he couldn't leave the coin in his shoe). If a spell requires a divine focus with a specific or minimum cost, the replacement divine focus must be of similar value to be used as the divine focus. A hidden priest adds half his class level (minimum +1) on all Bluff skill checks to send secret messages about religious matters, and on all Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages. He also adds this bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks relating to agents of the laws against his religion (including city guards in lands where these laws are in effect). This ability replaces one of the cleric's two 1st-level domain powers (her choice).",
        "unseen devotion (su)": "  At 8th level, a hidden priest can apply the Silent Spell and Still Spell feats to a spell he is about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. He can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four additional cleric levels beyond 8th. Even though this ability does not modify the spell's actual level, he cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that he is capable of casting. This ability always applies both feats (the cleric cannot use it to just apply one or the other). This ability replaces one of the cleric's two 8th-level domain powers (his choice)."

This spell is not added to your cleric list-you can cast it spontaneously only using planar bond. This alters spontaneous casting.",
        "invoke realm (su)": " When an idealist channels energy, she channels raw essence rather than positive or negative energy, superimposing a portion of her deity's planar realm over her location. This effect extends out to a radius of 10 feet, plus 5 feet for every 2 cleric levels she has beyond 1st, to a maximum radius of 55 feet at 19th level. This effect lasts for 1 round plus 1 round per point of the idealist's Charisma bonus. While this effect is active, the idealist gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks against creatures who worship her deity and a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks against creatures who do not. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This channeled energy imposes itself over the current terrain, changing its visual appearance to more thematically suit the energy's associated planar realm, but cannot hide obvious hazards or otherwise allow for a creature to hide any more effectively than the normal terrain would. This is an illusion (glamer) effect with a caster level equal to the idealist's level. Within the radius of the idealist's channeling, all alignment and magic planar traits are suppressed and replaced with the traits of the plane that matches the idealist's planar bond. This includes alignment, gravity, and magic traits (see pages 58-63 for information on planar traits.) In the case of the Astral Plane, since the time trait remains unaltered, your spellcasting only feels fast-you gain a +4 bonus on all concentration checks rather than the ability to apply Quickened Spell effects. This ability is considered channel energy for purposes of feats that grant additional uses of channel energy or allow the cleric to exclude creatures from channel energy's effects.

An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM's discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so.

While no longer able to harness the forces of nature like their neutral kin, these planar extremists find that their powers have shifted to reflect the Outer Plane most closely associated with their alignment. This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-druid. EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES The following archetype can be taken by an ex-druid immediately upon becoming an ex-druid, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-druid replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Planar extremixts can gain further levels in the druid class, even though becoming an ex-druid normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an atonement spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path. As a result, such a character must be the target of two atonement spells or a similar effect to regain her lost class features.

        "planar bond": " A planar extremist forms a bond with a manifestation of the Outer Plane with which she is aligned. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise functions as a druid's nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world. The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Plane. The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for eidolons for the unchained summoner PU class, as if the planar extremist were a summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but she can't cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion summoned, and she can't summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned through other means. As the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon's base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolon gains the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gains an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for her outsider companion, though any abilities that would grant evolution points to an animal companion do work. The planar extremist does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon. This replaces nature's bond.",

Additionally, the progenitor chooses one of two forms through which this bond expresses itself: magic or nature. A progenitor who chooses magic as her primal bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell slot. To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell's effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell's level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect (see page 63) with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. A progenitor who chooses nature as her primal bond can create plants as a full-round action. She can do so once per day plus one additional time per day per 5 levels. At the start of her next turn, so long as she is touching a solid surface underfoot, a 5-foot radius of mobile undergrowth springs to life around the progenitor for a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the progenitor's Wisdom bonus. Upon activating this ability, the progenitor chooses whether the undergrowth provides cover or difficult terrain. If the progenitor chooses cover, her undergrowth provides a cover bonus to AC to the progenitor and allies within the radius. If she chooses difficult terrain, enemies who enter the radius of undergrowth treat it as difficult terrain. A progenitor's undergrowth is treated as forest terrain if it provides cover and plains terrain if it provides difficult terrain.

Once per day as a standard action, she can target a creature within 30 feet and curse it with clumsiness and disorientation. The road keeper chooses whether to punish her target for entering the wild from a road or building, or vice versa. If her target is entering the wild, it treats every square of wilderness not on a road or in a building as difficult terrain. If her target is exiting the wild, it treats every square on a road or inside a building as difficult terrain. In either case, the ground feels uneven and the target suffers extreme vertigo during movement. The victim of this curse can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the road keeper's level + her Wisdom modifier) at the beginning of its turn each round to end the effect. The effect lasts until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the road keeper's level. A creature's movement isn't affected if it is burrowing, climbing, earth gliding, flying, or swimming. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.

Allies in the aura can exist comfortably in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Summerborn Triaxian.

For example, if he were in the line of a wizard's lightning bolt , he could have the spell skip his square and instead affect an adjacent square, even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line.

When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level.

The urushiol is immune to his own poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying his own poison or attacking with a weapon coated with it. Regardless of the delivery method he chooses, his poison has the following base statistics. Urushiol Venom : type poison (varies); save Fortitude negates; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urushiol's level + his Wisdom modifier. At 1st level, an urushiol can secrete this poison as a numbing injury poison on a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon by spending 1 of his daily doses as a standard action. He must choose a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon in his hand that deals piercing or slashing damage and that is not already poisoned or poisonous. The weapon remains poisoned until the urushiol scores a hit with it, the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round, or the poison is wiped away. At 4th level, an urushiol's body becomes so saturated with poison that even his flesh is poisonous. Whenever a creature damages the urushiol with a bite or swallow whole attack, the urushiol can release ingested poison into the creature by spending 1 of his daily doses as an immediate action. At 7th level, an urushiol can spend 2 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to secrete a contact poison and coat one of his limbs with the secreted poison. The urushiol can deliver the poison by making a successful touch attack as a standard action, which can be part of the same standard action he used to secrete the poison. If the attack misses, the poison persists upon his limb throughout the subsequent rounds until he hits a target or touches something else with his poisoned limb. At 11th level, an urushiol can spend 3 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to release a 20-foot-radius cloud of inhaled poison centered around him that lasts for 1 round. At 14th level, an urushiol's venom changes in frequency to 1/round for 4 rounds. In addition, when using his urushiol venom, an urushiol can spend an extra dose of his poison to change the damage type of the poison to Dexterity damage or Constitution damage.

Their speed and reflexes weave a net of impenetrable steel around them, from which they strike and harry their unfortunate opponents. The most common form of Aldori dueling (and arguably the easiest of the techniques to master) focuses on avoiding damage and disarming foes; these swordlords prefer to wear light or no armor, trusting their skill for protection. This archetype focuses on such techniques-characters seeking a more offensive method of focusing training on the Aldori dueling sword should consider the Aldori swordlord prestige class on page 20. However, this archetype also synergizes well with the powers and skills the prestige class offers.

At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice. The whirlpool isn't fast enough to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected by his own whirlpool, allowing him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures moving in it.

While this is a blanket term for all Hellknights-in-training (including those training to become signifers), it also applies specifically to fighters who focus their training to become Hellknights. Despite their lack of recognized rank, armigers are skilled and deadly warriors. Most armigers live and train at their order's citadel, working toward the day when they become full-fledged Hellknights. These armigers follow a brutally strict routine; they spend hours honing their combat skills against other trainees, obsessively studying in the citadel's libraries, or memorizing passages of the Hellknight philosophy known as the Measure and the Chain. At regular intervals, squads of armigers emerge from their citadels to patrol nearby cities or frontier lands, working to enforce Hellknight law and their order's edicts. On occasion, some armigers travel farther from their citadels, searching out those who mock the law and bringing them to justice by any means necessary. While a few do so as squires to full-fledged Hellknights, others strike out on their own or join bands of adventurers. To make up for the broken routine of adventuring life and the frequent compromises necessary in the presence of such allies, such roaming armigers are expected to perform frequent reckonings.

Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed. Long Range Shifty Shot (Ex) : At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed. This deed replaces the targeting deed.",

        "experimental firearm (ex)": "  At 1st level, an experimental gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger's gunsmith ability, but the firearm the experimental gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the experimental gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger's gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.",
        "innovations (ex)": "  An experimental gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The experimental gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the experimental gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the experimental gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp). At 5th level, and every four levels after that (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the experimental gunsmith learns one additional innovation from the list below. These represent constant and increasingly skilled tinkering with a single firearm in her possession, and when the experimental gunsmith gains an innovation, she may immediately apply it to her experimental firearm. Once an innovation has been selected, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces gun training. Expanded Capacity : The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat). Expanded Chamber : The experimental gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal. Grapple Launcher : The experimental gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%. Recoilless : The experimental gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it. Vial Launcher : The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target."

The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand's firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target's square, if the gunslinger's attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand's bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the firebrand's gunslinger level + the firebrand's Charisma modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand's daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way.

This deed replaces the deadeye deed. Planar Surge (Su) : At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element.

Careful Shot (Ex) As long as a scatter gunner has at least 1 grit point when making a scattering shot, he takes a penalty equal to his Wisdom modifier on his attack rolls against any allies in the area. He can spend 1 grit point when making a scattering shot to automatically miss a number of creatures equal to his Wisdom modifier. This replaces the deadeye deed. Scatter Artist (Ex) : At 3rd level, when using a firearm to make a scattering shot, a scatter gunner can spend 1 grit point to add one of the following effects to his attack. Restricted Barrel : The scattering shot attacks all creatures in a line rather than in a cone. The line's length is twice the length of the weapon's cone (30 feet for most early firearms).   Shaped Blast : Select one additional square adjacent to the scattering shot's area of effect; creatures in this square are also affected by the scattering shot.   Vortex : The firearm releases an explosive torrent of air in the scattering shot's affected area for 1 round, creating a strong wind effect (25 mph) that can disperse fog and smoke effects such as those created by  fog cloud . This replaces the utility shot deed. Overload (Ex) : At 7th level, a scatter gunner knows just how to hold his weapon to maximize its devastating scattering effects. As a full-round action, a scatter gunner can make a scattering shot to fire a concentrated payload of pellets that strains his firearm. This doubles the area affected by the scattering shot (a 30-foot cone for most early firearms), increases the firearm's misfire value by 2, and causes each successful attack to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit. This additional damage increases to 2d6 at 13th level and 3d6 at 19th level. The scatter gunner must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed. This replaces the dead shot deed. Satchel Shot (Ex) : At 7th level, as a full-round action, a scatter gunner can load and fire an explosive shell, consuming ammunition as though he had made a scattering shot. This functions like throwing a splash weapon at a grid intersection but uses his firearm's range increment, attack bonus, and magic special abilities (if any). The shell affects creatures in a 10-foot radius as though the scatter gunner had made a scattering shot against them, and damaged creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the scatter gunner's level + the scatter gunner's Dexterity modifier) or catch fire ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).

In any case, the colluding scoundrel rarely concerns herself overmuch with her allies' well-being.",

A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a -2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don't target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to -4 at 8th level and -6 at 15th level. The colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.

The plant master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one plant at a time. The plant master can also apply one of these aspects to his plant companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter's minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until he changes it. The companion's aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. A plant master can select or change the plant foci on both himself and his plant companion as part of the same swift action. Assassin Vine : The creature gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level.

To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

        "primal transformation (su)": " At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of 2 evolution points ( Advanced Player's Guide 60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying for evolutions and determining their effects. At 8th level, the number of evolution points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6. Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion's type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill. If a primal companion hunter's animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter's maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.",

The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn't already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks. This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times. This ability can grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the companion already possesses. This ability replaces second animal focus.",

        "source": "Adventurer's Guide pg. 131 The Mammoth Lords coexist with the great primeval beasts that roam their lands, surviving with the help of the animals' meat, hides, milk, bones, and more. These fearsome and wondrous animals have made their way into Kellid culture and tradition. Tribes are named after these creatures. Armor, clothing, weapons, and jewelry-when not fashioned from bone, hide, or teeth harvested from these beasts-are worked into images that evoke their shape and strength. They are even captured and trained for use as guardians, as hunters, or in the most iconic use, as mounts-though they're rarely tamed, as the Mammoth Lords value the ferociousness of these creatures. The sight of a Mammoth Lord atop an elephantine steed is one that few soon forget. For some of the people of the Mammoth Lords, this adoration and respect for the megafauna that share their realm goes one step further. Shamans ACG , oracles APG , druids, and others worship these animals as primal spirits of the world and draw great power from their faith. Others, like rangers and barbarians, are no less faithful in their belief, even though they focus more on physical combat than on spellcasting. Among the most devoted of these hunters are the so-called totem-bonded-hunters who are able to form a true spiritual bond with the powerful fauna that dominate the wildlands. Such a hunter embraces one of the realm's megafauna as a sort of spiritual guide, eventually attracting a mighty beast that travels with her and helps keep her territory free of invaders. By doing so, the totem-bonded hunter becomes something more than merely a guardian and provider for her tribe-she becomes a manifestation of the tribe's spiritual belief in the power of the land itself.",

At the GM's discretion, she can select other animal companions. In addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded's animal companion can grow further. If the animal companion's natural size is Large but it is normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear), the totembonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the companion's natural attacks by one die size. This ability alters animal companion.",
        "shared strength (su)": " At 1st level, the connection the totem-bonded has with her animal companion allows them to draw upon one another's strength. The totem-bonded can activate this ability as a swift action, and she can use it for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if the animal companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the totem-bonded. While the shared strength ability is active, the totembonded manifests one aspect of her animal companion drawn from the following list: low-light vision, scent, +1 bonus to natural armor, +10-foot bonus to speed, climb speed 30 feet, swim speed 40 feet, 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6), or slam (1d6); the natural attacks are all primary attacks, and the listed damage is for a Medium creature. The totem-bonded can select only a movement speed or natural attack that her animal companion also has, and an aspect cannot cause her speed or size to exceed that of her animal companion with this ability. At 8th level, the totem-bonded manifests two aspects of her animal companion, and she adds the following to her list of available aspects: +20-foot bonus to speed, fly speed 50 feet (average), increased size (as enlarge person), and powerful charge (doubles the damage dice dealt by the granted gore or slam attack). At 15th level, the damage dealt by any natural attacks granted by this ability increases by two die steps. A totem-bonded's animal companion also benefits from the shared strength ability, and while it is active, the animal understands the totem-bonded's known languages and can be pushed to perform an unfamiliar trick as a free action. At 8th level, the animal companion gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and a +2 bonus on checks with each skill in which it has at least 1 rank.

        "judgment (su)": " At 1st level, a kinslayer gains the following judgment. Slayer's Brand (Su) : When using this judgment, the kinslayer gains the ability to brand undead creatures with positive energy. To do so, she must make a successful melee touch attack against the undead creature. This attack deals an amount of positive energy damage equal to 1d6 + the kinslayer's Charisma modifier, and burns her personal symbol into the undead creature's flesh, bone, or even its incorporeal form. From that point onward, the kinslayer can sense the existence of the branded creature as if it were the target of a locate creature spell (caster level equal to 1/2 the kinslayer's inquisitor level). A slayer's brand lasts until the undead creature is destroyed or until the kinslayer uses this ability on another creature. This ability replaces the destruction judgment.",

Whenever she gains the ability to learn a teamwork feat, she can instead opt to learn one of the following modifications to her slayer's brand judgment. Branding Ray : The slayer's brand judgment can be used as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. A kinslayer can take this modification more than once. Whenever she does, she increases the range of her brand by 20 feet. Debilitating Brand : A creature currently affected by the slayer's brand judgment takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against the kinslayer who placed the brand. Devastating Brand : When the kinslayer attacks a creature that she has branded with her slayer's brand, she threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. If the kinslayer is good, she also gains a +2 sacred bonus on all rolls to confirm critical hits on a branded creature. Dual Brand : The kinslayer can have up to two creatures branded at a time. Holy Brand : The kinslayer can use her brand on creatures with the evil subtype as well as undead. Searing Brand : The kinslayer's slayer's brand deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every five inquisitor levels she has. If the creature hit with the slayer's brand is particularly vulnerable to bright light, the damage dice of her slayer's brand increases to d8s. A kinslayer must be at least 6th level to take this modification. Silver Brand : The kinslayer can use her brand on lycanthropes and creatures with vulnerability to silver as well as undead.

When wielding the holy book as a weapon, he deals base damage as if it were a cold iron light mace (but see Sacred Word below), is considered proficient with the book, takes no improvised weapon penalty, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the book. The tome serves as his holy symbol and divine focus, and can be enchanted as a magic weapon. He can replace his bonded tome with another book at any time, though he must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune himself to the new book. This ability replaces monster lore.",

The living grimoire receives the same number of spell slots per day as a warpriest of his inquisitor level, and receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by choosing a time each day for 1 hour of quiet contemplation while he studies his holy book. At 1st level, the living grimoire's holy book contains all 0-level inquisitor spells plus three 1st-level inquisitor spells of his choice. He also selects a number of additional 1st-level inquisitor spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to his holy book. At each new inquisitor level, he gains two new inquisitor spells of any spell levels he can cast (based on his new inquisitor level) for his holy book.

Like a warpriest's sacred weapon, the living grimoire's book deals damage based on the inquisitor's level, not the book's base damage (unless the inquisitor chooses to use the book's base damage). At 4th level, the living grimoire gains the ability to enhance his holy book with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the holy book a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 inquisitor levels the living grimoire has beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the holy book might have, to a maximum of +5. The living grimoire can enhance his holy book to have any of the special abilities listed in the warpriest's sacred weapon ability, subject to the same alignment restrictions, but adds bane to the general special ability list. Adding any of these special abilities to the holy book consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier. The holy book must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before the living grimoire can add any special abilities to it. The living grimoire can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his inquisitor level, but these rounds don't need to be consecutive. As with the warpriest sacred weapon ability, he determines the enhancement bonus and special abilities the first time he uses the ability each day, and they cannot be changed until the next day.

At 8th level, the living grimoire can tattoo one additional spell of 3rd level or lower upon himself. At 12th level, he can tattoo one additional spell of 4th level or lower upon himself, and at 16th level he can tattoo a final additional spell of any level upon himself.

Up to seven times per day, the inquisitor can make a single melee attack with his holy book against a target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or die (DC = 10 + 1/2 the living grimoire's inquisitor level + his Intelligence modifier). Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the living grimoire's word of god ability for 24 hours.

She can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 inquisitor levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). A monster tactician cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in this way at a time; if she uses another, any existing summon monster immediately ends. These summon monster spells are considered to be part of the monster tactician's spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, she can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic items she creates, so long as she can use this ability to cast the required spells. At 2nd level and each level thereafter, the monster tactician can add one monster from the expanded summon monster list (see pages 28-29) to her list of available summoned creatures. She can add a new option to any summon monster spell she can cast at the time she chooses the monster; once made, these choices cannot be changed. This ability replaces judgment.",

        "divine witness (su)": " Every oathkeeper inquisitor develops a unique personal symbol, which she can use to seal an agreement between two or more willing parties. The agreement, whether it's a trade contract, a truce, or a political marriage, must be as detailed as possible and then signed in the oathkeeper's presence by every creature involved. Creatures must sign of their own free will-any magical or physical coercion will cause the contract to crumble into ash when the oathkeeper attempts to place her seal upon it. So long as no mystic or physical force is influencing any participating creature, the oathkeeper can mystically seal the arrangement with her personal symbol, binding all signing parties into upholding their ends of the bargain for the length of time spelled out in the agreement. Should any oathbound creature break the exact wording of the contract, the agreement is dissolved and the offending creature is cursed, taking a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the oathkeeper's Wisdom modifier for a number of weeks equal to the oathkeeper's inquisitor level. Furthermore, the inquisitor's symbol appears as a mystic symbol on the offending creature's throat and hands, allowing the oathkeeper to know the creature's location at all times, as per the discern location spell. If a creature is forced into breaking the agreement by magic or overwhelming physical force (for example, breaking an agreement not to harm via a compulsion spell or by physically hurling an oathbound creature to deal damage to another), then the agreement dissipates harmlessly. The oathkeeper's curse is a curse effect, but it can be removed only with a miracle or wish spell. This replaces monster lore.",
        "oathbreaker's scourge (su)": " At 2nd level, if an oathkeeper is given physical evidence of a broken agreement and asked to hunt down the contract's breaker by the offended party, the oathkeeper gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Diplomacy and Survival skill checks to gather information about and track the target. The inquisitor is also treated as being 3 levels higher for the purpose of one judgment she uses against the deal breaker, so long as she keeps possession of the evidence. If the oathkeeper uses oathbreaker's scourge when attacking someone who is actually innocent of fraud-due to forgery, hasty judgments, or other deceptions-she loses access to all of her oathkeeper archetype abilities for 1 month or until she is the target of an atonement spell.

Once per day, the inquisitor can use this ability to create one of the following effects. Each is a free action to use. Aggression : The preacher may reroll an attack roll that she just made before the results of the roll are revealed. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Defense : When the inquisitor would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action she may add a +4 insight bonus to her Armor Class against that attack, and if this makes the inquisitor's AC higher than the opponent's attack roll, the attack misses. Warning : When a preacher's ally within line of sight would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, she may call out a warning to that ally, and the attacker must reroll the attack and use the results of the second roll. The ally must be able to hear the preacher and must not be helpless for this ability to have any effect. Whenever the preacher could select a bonus teamwork feat (at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level), she can instead choose to increase her number of uses per day of this ability by one.

More benign versions of the practice believe that sin, or evil, is taken out of the world when a sin is devoured, denying the enemy's soul to the enemy's god and purifying the world of its taint. Followers of malevolent churches believe that consuming the sins of good folk not only corrupts the enemy soul to keep it from the celestial planes, but also taints the souls of those who witness the sin-eating or the corpse of its victim. Consuming sins empowers the sin eater, at least for a time.",
        "eat sin (sp)": "  At 1st level, as a free action, when the sin eater inquisitor kills an enemy, she may eat the sins of that enemy by spending 1 minute adjacent to its corpse. This provokes attacks of opportunity. The inquisitor can rush this ritual, performing it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, but she only gains half the normal benefit (see below). Eating the enemy's sins heals the inquisitor of a number of hit points of damage equal to 1d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +5). The enemy must have been killed by the sin eater within the last hour, and it must have had at least as many Hit Dice as half the inquisitor's level. The inquisitor can use this ability once for each enemy she kills. This ability has no effect on mindless creatures or those with Intelligence 2 or less. At 5th level, the healing increases to 2d8 plus her inquisitor level (maximum +10); it increases to 3d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +15) at 9th level and to 4d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +20) at 13th level. In some faiths, this 'eating' is a purely symbolic act, while in others, the inquisitor must eat a small amount of food and water as part of the ritual. A few extreme faiths actually require the inquisitor to eat some of the body of the slain enemy. At 8th level, when a sin eater eats the sins of a creature that would rise as an undead (such as someone slain by a shadow, spectre, or vampire), the sin eater may choose to accept 1 temporary negative level to absorb the taint in the corpse, preventing it from rising as an undead. This negative level can be removed with the appropriate magic, though it automatically expires after 24 hours, and never becomes a permanent negative level. At the GM's discretion, this ability may prevent a ghost from using its rejuvenation ability. This ability replaces an inquisitor's domain.",

The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade.

As part of activating her judgment ability, the suit seeker can draw an impromptu array of two cards from a complete harrow deck she owns. Once drawn, the array remains the same until the judgment effect ends, though the inquisitor can change her judgment at any time as a swift action, as normal. The act of drawing an improvised array requires a free hand, though the suit seeker can keep a drawn array in her belt or otherwise on her person to perform actions with both hands while still maintaining the cards' benefits. At 1st level, as long as the suit seeker has at least one card in her improvised array that matches her current judgment, she increases her effective inquisitor level by a number of levels equal to the number of matching cards for the purpose of determining that judgment's effects. At 8th level, when a suit seeker gains her second judgment, she can forgo pronouncing a second judgment and instead draw four cards for her improvised array. At 16th level, she can forgo pronouncing a second and third judgment and instead draw up to six cards for her improvised array, or she can forgo only her third judgment and draw an array of four cards. In addition to increasing her effective inquisitor level for the purpose of the corresponding judgment, a suit seeker with three or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains immunity to ability damage to the corresponding ability score. A suit seeker with five or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability score.

        "relic magic (su)": " Antiquarians emulate Arustun, founder of the Jistka Imperium, by exploring and recording the remnants of lost civilizations. Rather than using extracts, an antiquarian carries a collection of holy and unholy symbols, charms, and trinkets. Though an antiquarian may never know who or what grants him his power, he can produce magical effects all the same. Relic magic functions as the alchemy class feature, except as noted below. An antiquarian begins play with a collection of religious trinkets that functions as his formula book and weighs 2 pounds total, with each trinket functioning as a formula. Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian's trinket collection is too esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian does not suffer from arcane spell failure. An antiquarian doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, he cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. This alters alchemy.",

Once he identifies a magic item in this way, he can use Spellcraft to attempt to identify the properties of the magic item as if he had used detect magic. Furthermore, he can detect whether an item is cursed if his check to identify the magic item exceeds the DC by 5. This replaces poison lore.",

        "familiar (ex)": " At 2nd level, a bonded investigator gains a familiar to aid him. This familiar functions as the wizard arcane bond class feature, using the bonded investigator's class level to determine the familiar's special abilities.

They record this information meticulously so that those who follow in their footsteps can travel swiftly and safely within the studied area. Rather than studying poisons like many investigators do, cartographers use their alchemical expertise to create better inks that allow them to draw maps with incredible level of detail.",
        "studied terrain (ex)": "  At 2nd level, a cartographer can expend one use of inspiration to sketch a map and take notes of his surroundings. Drawing the map takes 10 minutes. While he is within the studied area, the cartographer can use inspiration on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. If he already has the ability to use inspiration on any of these skills without expending a use of inspiration, he gains an additional +1 bonus on checks with that skill while in the studied area. A cartographer can draw three types of maps. He cannot combine different map types in the same map, and areas within range that would belong in the other categories are excluded. Dungeon Map : While indoors, underground, or in any other type of environment where visibility is limited by walls, the radius is 100 feet per level, and only areas that the cartographer has explored within the past 24 hours count as studied terrain. Areas explored after drawing the map do not retroactively become part of the studied terrain. Overland Map : In natural terrain, the radius of the mapped area is equal to 1 mile per investigator level. If he is unable to see the whole area, he extrapolates and uses his knowledge of geography to fill in the blanks. Town Map : While in an urban area or ruins, the radius is 1,000 feet per level or the entirety of the urban or ruined area, whichever is smaller. Much like alchemy, cartography requires materials, but the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so well as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink-a great deal of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this reason, a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time. The benefits remain in effect until the cartographer studies a new area or refreshes his inspiration pool. This replaces poison lore and poison resistance.",
        "geographic lore (ex)": "  At 3rd level, a cartographer gains a deeper understanding of wilderness terrain. Whenever he is on the Material Plane, he can determine where true north is as a full-round action. Furthermore, he can create and sell maps to earn a number of gold pieces per week of dedicated work equal to half his Knowledge (geography) check result per week. This replaces keen recollection.",
        "swift travels (ex)": "  At 4th level, while in studied terrain, a cartographer intuitively knows the easiest, shortest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the cartographer treats any trackless terrain as though he were on a trail, and he treats any terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway. He can extend the benefit to up to one creature per investigator level traveling with him. This replaces swift alchemy."

He trains himself to remain undetected and ignored in order to conduct his investigations without opposition or bothersome questions. By staying unseen, a cipher can follow and observe his quarry; being overlooked in a crowd suits him just fine.",
        "unassuming (ex)": " A cipher relies on subtlety, rather than skills that would draw attention to him. A cipher removes Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform from his list of class skills, and he can never use them with inspiration, regardless of any talents or other abilities he might have. A cipher can use his inspiration on any Disguise, Escape Artist, Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand, and Stealth check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of the normal investigator ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspiration. This alters the investigator's class skills and inspiration.",
        "inattention blindness (su)": " At 1st level, a cipher can blind nearby creatures to his presence. A creature who would become aware of a cipher's presence when the cipher is within 10 feet per cipher level must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 10 + the cipher's investigator level + his Intelligence modifier or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6. The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute the cipher remains in range. A creature that was aware of the cipher's presence prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A cipher can affect only one creature with inattention blindness at any given time, plus one additional creature at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven creatures at 19th level. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can't affect an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature. If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously, they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches the maximum number of creatures it can affect. The cipher can suppress or activate inattention blindness as a free action, and dismiss its effects on any affected creature within range as a move action. This ability replaces trapfinding, poison lore, poison resistance, poison immunity, and trap sense.",
        "null aura (su, sp)": " At 4th level, a cipher becomes much harder to notice with divinations. He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination spells, spell-like abilities, and effects. Attempts to locate the cipher with scrying and other spells that share the knowledge and connection rules with scrying function only if the caster has firsthand or familiar knowledge of the cipher, or has one of his body parts (not from secondhand knowledge, possession, or a likeness of the cipher). If the caster does not meet these conditions, or if the cipher succeeds at a saving throw to negate such an effect, the spell or effect reveals nothing but darkness as if the target was invalid or did not exist; unlike normal, even if she is using a spell with a single target, the caster of the divination effect does not discover that her target succeeded at a saving throw. At 9th level, a cipher benefits from constant nondetection , requiring those who wish to use divinations on him to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 15 + his investigator level). This ability replaces swift alchemy and the investigator talent gained at 9th level.",
        "evasive (ex)": " At 3rd level, a cipher can avoid unusual attacks. He gains the evasion ability, and at 11th level, he gains the improved evasion ability. This ability replaces the investigator talents gained at 3rd and 11th levels.",
        "tenuous threat (su)": " At 5th level, a cipher's opponents tend to forget that he is a threat. The first time each day that he successfully hits an opponent who is not the target of his studied combat with a melee attack, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the cipher's investigator level + his Intelligence modifier) or be affected by the cipher's studied strike. This is a mind-affecting effect. This ability alters studied strike, and replaces the investigator talent gained at 5th level.",
        "hide in plain sight (su)": " At 7th level, a cipher can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed; as long as his observer is within range of his inattention blindness ability (even if it is not affected by inattention blindness), he can hide without anything to actually hide behind. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 7th level."

At 1st level, a conspirator can use inspiration on any Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check. He can later choose to trade an investigator talent for the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspirtation, provided he is trained in the skill. A conspirator adds half his investigator level (minimum 1) on Bluff checks to appear innocent and on Disguise checks. This ability replaces trapfinding and alters inspiration.",
        "watcher sense (ex)": " At 3rd level, a conspirator is able to sense when someone else is watching him. He gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, prying eyes, and other magical effects used to watch him, as well as on Perception checks to act on the surprise round. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter. Additionally, at 7th level, if a scrying sensor is invisible, the invisibility does not increase the DC of the conspirator's Perception check to notice it, regardless of whether or not he is using an ability that allows him to see invisible things. The DC for his Perception check is equal to 20 + the spell's level (with no +20 increase to the Perception DC for a moving invisible sensor or no +40 increase for an immobile invisible sensor).

Allies within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar gain a +1 insight bonus to their ACs and on saving throws against extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of the same type and all the same subtypes as the monster identified. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cryptid scholar's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he uses knowledgeable strike (see below), whichever comes first. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). A creature cannot benefit from opportune advice regarding more than one specific kind of monster at a time. Once the cryptid scholar has used this ability to provide a bonus against a specific kind of monster, he can't grant a bonus against that same kind of monster again for 24 hours, unless he expends one use of inspiration when taking a move action to use this ability. This ability replaces studied combat, and the cryptid scholar cannot choose investigator talents that add effects to studied combat or studied strike.",
        "knowledgeable strike (ex)": " At 4th level, the cryptid scholar can direct allies to exploit a monster's weaknesses. If the cryptid scholar ends his opportune advice early as a move action, each ally within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar deals additional damage on its next successful unarmed, natural, or weapon attack against that specific kind of monster within 1 round. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level and increases by 1d6 for every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of knowledgeable strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to knowledgeable strike. Ranged attacks gain this additional damage only against a target within 30 feet. The ally must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Knowledgeable strike cannot be used against a creature with concealment. This ability replaces studied strike."

To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use grave words OA as spell-like ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.",

While a hallucinist's body sways oddly under the effects of his hallucinogen, it grants him strange insights that reveal things to him that others can't see. Hallucinists know that others can't function with these expanded senses, and they use that fact to repurpose their hallucinations as distractions or assaults against their enemies.",
        "psychedelic perception (su)": " In addition to magical extracts, a hallucinist learns to swiftly mix various psychoactive substances, using a fraction of his own power to create a magical hallucinogen that he can imbibe to grant himself powers of psychedelic perception. A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist's mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does. At 1st level, the effects of a hallucinogen last for 1 minute per investigator level, and the hallucinogen grants low-light vision and a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks, but imposes a -2 penalty to his Dexterity. At 3rd level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per the hallucinist's investigator level and the insight bonus on Perception checks increases to +4.

If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug. This ability replaces poison lore.",

At 11th level, a hallucinist becomes completely immune to drug addiction, but he can choose to lower this immunity for any particular drug. If he becomes addicted to a drug, he must fully recover from the addiction before he can resume his immunity to addiction to that drug. This ability replaces all instances of poison resistance and poison immunity.",
        "shared hallucinations (sp)": " At 3rd level, a hallucinist under the effects of his hallucinogen can share and manipulate his hallucinatory revelations. By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror OA . At 5th level, he can create an effect similar to synesthesia OA Any of the effects remain only while the hallucinist concentrates upon it, for up to 1 round per hallucinist's investigator level, but otherwise function as the spell. The DC of saving throws against these effects is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hallucinist's investigator level + his modifier. At 9th level, a hallucinist can expend 10 minutes of the duration of the hallucinogen or one use of inspiration to use aura alteration OA on one creature or object (unlike the other three abilities, this does not require concentration). This ability replaces keen recollection, and the investigator talents gained at 5th and 9th levels.",
        "simultaneous study (su)": " At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place. This ability alters studied combat and replaces all remaining trap sense."

A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the Holomog demolitionist's level + his Intelligence modifier) to reduce this damage by half. At 9th level, the damage increases to 4d6, and the investigator can create this effect with a ranged weapon by targeting a wall or object within 30 feet.

For every 4 levels he has beyond 6th, the investigator can create an additional 10 feet of difficult terrain, to a maximum of 40 feet at 18th level. This is a physical alteration that remains in place until the surface is altered again (the road is repaved, the floor repaired, etc.), and the Holomog demolitionist ignores the effects of any difficult terrain he creates in this way. At 10th level, the Holomog demolitionist can use this ability to create clouds of dust and rubble that create concealment rather than difficult terrain in the same area. This concealment lasts 1d4 rounds plus 1 round for every 4 investigator levels, and the Holomog demolitionist is affected by the concealment as normal.

When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by -2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a -2 to the check instead of a -6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 x 10 minutes of work). This ability replaces trapfinding.",
        "voice mimicry (ex)": "  At 2nd level, an infiltrator learns to mimic voices and sounds around him. Using this ability requires a special Disguise check, and creatures hearing the voice can make a Perception check to discover the ruse. An infiltrator can attempt to emulate any creature or other sound he's heard clearly for at least 1 minute. The bonuses or penalties to this special Disguise check are modified in the following ways, all of which are cumulative. Disguised Voice Check Modifier   Voice is not your own, but not that of a distinct individual +5   Voice is that of a different gender -2   Voice is that of a different race -2   Voice is that of a different age category -2   Voice is that of a different size category -5 Also, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise ( Core Rulebook 95). This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items, feats, and traits that affect typical disguises do not affect this disguise check. At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of its master of disguise class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a -3 penalty for a different size category).

At 4th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability and designate a single noncombat task that could make use of the teamwork feat (for instance, designating the Cooperative Crafting APG feat and a session of crafting). As long as the allies pursue the task uninterrupted, instead of experiencing the benefits for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the majordomo's investigator level, her allies retain the benefits until the task is complete, to a maximum of 8 hours.

He can later spend an investigator talent to gain the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks. This alters inspiration.",
        "take a bit (ex)": "  The malice binder gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat at 1st level. At 3rd level, he can use inspiration to improve a steal combat maneuver check by spending one use of inspiration rather than two. This replaces trapfinding and trap sense.",
        "fettering (su)": "  A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes. Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance. An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours. Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action. The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator's class level + the investigator's Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours. This replaces alchemy. Divine Dread (Su) : Binding a token to a holy symbol anathema to the target fills the creature with supernatural dread, imposing the shaken condition for 1 round per class level. At 6th level, the target is frightened instead. At 11th level, the target becomes panicked instead. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead shaken for a single round. Hexing Shield (Su) : By placing a token between two shiny copper coins and then putting them in a creature's mouth, the malice binder can ward himself or others. This fetter grants whoever holds it in his mouth a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws against the target's spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. The fetter lasts 10 minutes per class level, but whoever holds it in his mouth cannot eat, drink, speak, or cast spells with verbal components without ending the effect early. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the resistance bonus granted improves by 1, to a maximum of +8 at 19th level. The malice binder can have only one hexing shield active at a time. Incapacitate (Su) : By rubbing soot into a token, the malice binder clouds his target's senses or stifles the target's tongue. This fetter deafens or silences the target for 1 round per 2 class levels (minimum 1 round). Silenced creatures cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, but they are otherwise unrestricted from making sounds. At 6th level, a malice binder can either blind his target or both silence and deafen it. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead dazzled for a single round. Repulse (Su) : By binding a token to a bit of rancid meat, the malice binder can impede his target's approach. Once activated, this fetter forces its target to spend twice the normal amount of movement to approach the fetter while within range of its effect; it does not affect the target's ability to move away. At 11th level, the fetter's target cannot physically approach within 10 feet of the fetter, as if affected by a repulsion spell. This fetter remains active for 1 minute per class level and can be handed to another creature or left somewhere to ward against a witch's entry. A target can overcome this effect with a successful Will saving throw when the fetter is first activated. Salting Wounds (Su) : The malice binder can rub salt into a wound-his own or that of an adjacent ally-treating the wound as a token to protect the injured creature from the danger that threatens it. This fetter grants a +2 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the creature that caused the original wound, which is treated as the fetter's target for the purposes of how often it can be used. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the deflection bonus to AC increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. This fetter is painful to whom it protects, sickening the protected creature while the fetter remains in effect. Shackle (Su) : Binding a token to manacles or a length of rope causes the restraints to fly out and entangle the target. A target can avoid this fetter with a successful Reflex save. An entangled target can attempt to escape as a standard action with either an Escape Artist check or a combat maneuver check using the same DC as the initial saving throw. Using masterwork manacles in this fetter increases the escape DC by 2. Temptation (Su) : Anointing a token with incense or scented oils creates a supernaturally appealing object to attract a target's attention. Once activated, this fetter lasts for 1 minute per class level. If the target approaches within the fetter's area of effect, it is compelled to approach the fetter and pick it up; the compulsion can be negated with a successful Will save. This effect ends immediately if the target picks up the fetter or the fetter moves more than 30 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels away from the target. At 11th level, the fetter fascinates its target once picked up, affecting it as if by the spell hypnotism for 1 round per class level; this fetter is not limited by the target's Hit Dice. Witch Compass (Su) : Placing a token on top of a compass causes the needle to point toward the malice binder's target for 1 hour per class level, granting a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to track that creature. The target must be within 1 mile per class level, or else the needle spins aimlessly. Wrack (Su) : The binder can drive an iron nail through a token to leave his target sickened with pain until the end of the malice binder's next turn. At 6th level, the target is instead staggered until the end of the malice binder's next turn. The target can negate this fetter with a successful Fortitude save. For this fetter, a binder can use a clear footprint as a token; finding an appropriate footprint requires a successful Survival skill check to track the target.",
        "take a bit more (ex)": "  At 8th level, taking a bit of clothing or hair to use as a token becomes second nature for the malice binder. He gains Quick Steal as a bonus feat. When attempting to steal a token, he gains a +2 competence bonus on combat maneuver checks. This replaces poison resistance.",
        "witch trapper (ex)": "  Beginning at 11th level, whenever the malice binder would gain a fetter, he can instead select a ranger trap ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 64), treating his investigator level as his ranger level for the purpose of determining the trap's effect.

At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind's choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind's behest. This skill check uses the mastermind's skill ranks instead of the ally's. The mastermind's affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check. Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration die when making the check. At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benef it on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks. At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1stlevel effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally's Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.",

He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have diff iculty piercing a mastermind's barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind's thoughts speaks all of the mastermind's languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail.

Stepping through the portal takes 5 feet of movement, and while the rest of her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, the extra movement from the portal is a teleportation effect that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. At 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature's movements using his knowledge of the creature's psychology. He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn't yet identified the serial killer's true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler's guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature's general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don't apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM's discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature's passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature's movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.

The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier.

This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +3 at 8th level. At 11th level, a skeptic is immune to fear effects. This ability replaces poison resistance.",
        "smite haunt (su)": " Normally, damaging a haunt is a tricky affair requiring the ability to channel positive energy or wield spells capable of doing the same, but the skeptic learns methods of using her own convictions to accomplish the same feat. At 4th level, as a standard action, a skeptic can focus her willpower to damage an active haunt. She must be within a haunt's area to smite the haunt. When the skeptic uses this ability, she deals an amount of damage to the haunt equal to her studied strike bonus. This ability replaces swift alchemy.",
        "exorcising touch (su)": " At 7th level, a skeptic can damage a creature currently possessing another without lethally harming the possessed creature. To make an exorcising strike, the skeptic must make a touch attack against the possessed creature. On a hit, she damages the possessing creature or entity, dealing an amount of lethal damage equal to her studied strike bonus damage. The possessed creature takes this amount of damage as nonlethal damage at the same time. This ability replaces the investigator talent the skeptic would otherwise gain at 7th level."

      "Sleuth": {
        "source": "Advanced Class Guide pg. 101 A sleuth is an investigator who relies on good fortune and guile rather than alchemy. Having no mystical energy intrinsic to her, she must forgo the more magical aspects of alchemy to solve her mysteries with wits, gumption, and the fickle consideration of luck.",
        "sleuth's luck (ex)": "  At 1st level, a sleuth gains a fluctuating pool of luck, measuring her ability to get out of scrapes. At the start of each day, a sleuth has a number of luck points equal to her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1). Her luck goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1), though feats, magic items, and spells that grant either grit or panache points can also grant a sleuth luck points equal to the amount of grit or panache they grant. A sleuth spends luck to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains luck in the following ways. Rolling a Natural 20 on a Knowledge or Sense Motive Check : While on an investigation, a sleuth regains luck by uncovering secrets. Rolling a natural 20 on these skill checks while actively investigating causes the sleuth to regain 1 luck point. Such skill checks made for more mundane reasons (such as normal research or using Sense Motive to gain information during normal bargaining or while gambling) do not regain luck for the sleuth. Determining which skill checks qualify is up to the GM. Rolling a 6 or Higher on an Inspiration Roll : When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die while on an investigation and the die comes up a 6 or higher, she regains 1 luck point. (If she rolls multiple inspiration dice at a time, she regains 1 luck point if the total is 6 or higher.) Like regaining luck via a natural 20 on a qualifying skill check, inspiration checks made for more mundane reasons don't qualify for regaining luck. The GM is the final arbitrator for what rolls qualify. It's possible for a investigator to regain 2 luck points on the same Skill check, if both the qualifying skill check is a natural 20 and any inspiration roll made is a 6 or higher. This and the 1st-level deeds below replace alchemy. A sleuth cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.",
        "deeds": " Sleuths spend luck points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant a sleuth some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as a sleuth has at least 1 luck point. At 1st level, a sleuth gains the following deeds. Daring (Ex) : At 1st level, a sleuth can spend 1 luck point when he makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll d6 and add the result to the check. He can choose to add this die after he rolls. If the d6 roll is a natural 6, he rolls another d6 and adds it to the check. He can continue to do this as long as he rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Opportunistic Evasion (Ex) : At 1st level, when a sleuth succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an effect that still deals damage on a successful save, he can spend 1 luck point as an immediate action to instead take no damage for that effect. Sleuth's Initiative (Ex) : At 1st level, as long as the sleuth has at least 1 luck point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the weapon is not hidden, he can draw a single light or one-handed melee weapon as part of the initiative check. (Unlike with swashbuckler deeds, this does not have to be a piercing weapon.) At 4th level, a sleuth gains the following deeds. These abilities replace swift alchemy. Make It Count (Ex) : When a sleuth uses studied strike, he can spend 1 luck point to apply an investigator talent that he doesn't already know and which affects studied strike to his studied strike. He must be able to fulfill that talent's prerequisites. Run Like Hell (Ex) : At 4th level, a sleuth can spend 1 luck point to gain a +20-foot bonus to his speed for 1 minute. Furthermore, while under the effect of this bonus, if he moves more than his normal speed in a round, he gains a +4 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn. Second Chance (Ex) : At 4th level, when a sleuth rolls an inspiration die or uses daring deed, he can spend 1 luck point to reroll either the inspiration or the daring deed die. If he rolls a 6 or higher on this reroll, he does not regain a luck point, and no matter what he rolls on either roll, he must keep the reroll result, even if it is lower.",
        "investigator talents": "  The following investigator talents complement the sleuth archetype: amazing inspiration, combat inspiration, device talent, effortless aid, expanded inspiration, hidden agendas, inspirational expertise, inspired alertness, inspired intimidator, perceptive tracking, quick study, rogue talent, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration.",
        "grit, luck, and panache": " Grit, luck, and panache represent three different means by which heroes can gain access to the same heroic pool, using it to accomplish fantastic feats. For characters with a mix of grit, luck, and panache, they pool the three resources together into a combined pool. (Those who use panache and luck do not gain twice their Charisma bonus in their pool.) For feats, magic items, and other effects, a panache user can spend and gain luck points in place of grit or panache points, and vice versa. A luck user does not count as a grit or panache user to satisfy feat prerequisites."

The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier. As he goes up in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells with the casting time as above. At 5th level, he can use augury .

Some star watchers also use these observations to predict fate and significant events, such as natural disasters.",

        "astrology (su)": "  A star watcher studies a symbolic language of the heavens known as astrology. Equal parts art form and science, astrology can be used to read the future and affect it in subtle ways. Much like an alchemist or investigator, a star watcher collects formulae in a formula book. However, the formulae resemble star charts, and unlike alchemists or normal investigators, he uses these formulae along with personal details and astronomical measurements to make horoscopes-magical calculations stored much like scrolls-in which he can store spells. In many ways, the star watcher's horoscopes function like extracts, with the following exceptions. A star watcher's horoscope is always keyed to a specific creature that must be willing and present when the star watcher prepares the horoscope. Only the creature to which a horoscope is keyed can activate it and be affected by it. A horoscope is 'cast' by reading it as a standard action, though a star watcher can draw and read a horoscope as a single standard action. A star watcher doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, a star watcher cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. A star watcher can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but a star watcher's formula book is too esoteric for anyone except another star watcher to learn spells from. This alters alchemy.",
        "starfinding (ex)": "  A star watcher adds half his level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks. He can also use astrological methods to read people. By checking his star charts, he can use Knowledge (geography) in place of Sense Motive checks. This replaces trapfinding and trap sense.",
        "investigator talents": "  A star watcher can select the following talents, in addition to general investigator talents. Horoscopic Scrolls (Su) : The star watcher gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. He can use the feat to create an arcane scroll of any formula he knows. Unlike horoscopes created with the astrology ability, anyone capable of using arcane scrolls can cast a spell from these scrolls. Additionally, the star watcher can use scrolls as if he were an arcane spellcaster. He can use Knowledge (geography) to identify scrolls as if using detect magic . He must hold the scroll for 1 round to attempt such a check. Precognition (Su) : A star watcher can glimpse into the mysterious possibilities of the future and prepare a horoscope he knows he'll need later. Once per day as a swift action, a star watcher can treat an open extract slot as though he had prepared a horoscope keyed to himself in it, choosing one formula of the appropriate level from his formula book. A star watcher must be at least 4th level to select this talent. Returning Star (Ex) : Whenever the star watcher uses a starknife as a thrown weapon against a target of his studied combat, the starknife automatically returns as if it had the returning property. The star watcher must have the shooting star investigator talent to select this talent. Shooting Star (Ex) : A star watcher can calculate trajectories with terrifying accuracy. He can apply the benefits of studied combat, studied strike, and investigator talents that add effects to studied combat or studied strike while using a starknife as a thrown weapon.

When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common Inner Sea human language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM's discretion, some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Linguistics checks. This replaces trapfinding.",

If the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature's Bluff skill bonus) to identify the creature's starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding, the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target's attitude toward any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to improve the target's attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy DC determined by the target's starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter's choosing.

Additional poison selections can be added to this list with GM approval. The Fortitude save DC of these poisons is 10 + the toxin codexer's Intelligence modifier + the extract level of the poison. Poisons created in this way are unstable and become inert after 1 day if not used. Once the poison is administered to a target, the duration is as normal for that poison's type, even if longer than 1 day.

Alternatively, she can use gather power to reduce the cost of a defense, infusion, or utility wild talent by 1, regardless of whether she gathers power for longer or has abilities that increase the burn reduction from gather power. Finally, she can siphon the energy into healing herself, recovering 2 hit points per kineticist level. When a blighted defiler uses steal power, she afflicts the area within a radius of 250 feet per kineticist level (maximum 5,000 feet at 20th level) by stunting plants as the stunt growth option from diminish plants , weakening and killing minor wildlife (creatures too small or insignificant to themselves have statistics), and reducing the rate of live birth among the other surviving creatures in the area. If a blighted defiler uses steal power in an area that overlaps a previous use of her steal power within the same month, she expends a daily use and the remaining area is still blighted as above, but she doesn't gain any benefits. Steal power doesn't work in barren landscapes, the void of space, or other places without enough life to steal. This alters gather power.",

She can't use abilities to substitute her Strength modifier for another ability score when determining damage from wild talents. A blighted defiler gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow based on her current burn total + the number of times she successfully used steal power that day. For instance, a 9th-level blighted defiler who used steal power twice and had 1 point of burn would add a +3 bonus on attack rolls and a +6 bonus on damage rolls. A blighted defiler does not gain size bonuses to physical ability scores or a chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks from elemental overflow.

She must use steal power on a healthy area and take none of the three usual benefits, and this doesn't count as a use of steal power for elemental might or stolen strength. This grants her buffer 1 life point. It can hold 1 life point at 6th level, 2 life points at 11th level, and 3 life points at 16th level. When using steal power, she can spend 1 life point to gain the benefits even in an area she already blighted that month. Life points remain in the buffer until she spends them. This replaces internal buffer.",

After the third time she successfully uses steal power in a given day, she gains a +2 size bonus to Strength and to either Dexterity or Constitution until she recovers uses of steal power. Starting at 11th level, after the fifth time the blighted defender successfully uses steal power in a day, she instead gains a +4 size bonus to Strength and a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, and she can use the life energy to increase her size category by one (to a maximum of Large). Starting at 16th level, after the seventh time the blighted defender successfully uses steal power in a day, her size bonuses increase to +6 to Strength, +4 to either Dexterity or Constitution, and +2 to the remaining ability score, and she can also grow to Huge. Finally, at 20th level, after the 9th time she successfully uses steal power in a day, she can also grow to Gargantuan. All of these size increases function as kinetic form, meaning they don't change her ability scores in any way. A blighted defiler can never gain an elemental defense, even from expanded defense. This replaces elemental defense.",
        "steal life (su)": "  At 20th level, a blighted defiler who successfully uses steal power when gathering power as a move action can use a standard action on the same turn and choose a living creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 20 + the blighted defiler's Strength modifier) or die; this is a death effect. If the creature dies and was CR 10 or higher, on the blighted defiler's next turn, she counts as if she had used a full round to gather power with steal power. If the target survives or was lower than CR 10, she loses all benefits from both her gather power and steal power, as normal at the end of her turn. This replaces omnikinesis."

When she does, some of her existing burn is unloaded into the departing soul, racking it with unspeakable torment, but reducing her current burn total by 1 point. A soul used in this way cannot be brought back to life as if it died of a death effect. Using a soul like this doesn't heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn immediately, but does enable the dark elementalist to heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn normally. At 6th level, racking a soul in this way forces anyone trying to bring the creature back to life to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the dark elementalist's kineticist level) or the attempt fails. At 11th level, even if the creature returns from the dead, its soul is so damaged by the agony that it takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage (or 3d10 points of sanity damage if using the sanity system found on page 12).

She can use wild talents of the same element that she chose in this way to meet prerequisites for these wild talents. Instead of gaining one kineticist blast, a terrakineticist chooses one simple blast from each element that has more than one simple blast. When in a corresponding terrain, as determined by the ranger favored terrain categories, her element changes to the corresponding element (granting her class skills, basic utility wild talent, simple blast, and elemental defense as appropriate), and she gains all the wild talents she selected from the corresponding element. Aether corresponds to urban and the Ethereal Plane; air corresponds to hill, mountain, plains, and the Plane of Air; fire corresponds to desert and the Plane of Fire; earth corresponds to underground and the Plane of Earth; water corresponds to cold, swamp, water, and the Plane of Water; and wood corresponds to forest, jungle, the First World, and the Positive Energy Plane. In areas that might count as multiple types of terrain, the GM decides which element predominates, and in certain areas not covered by the ranger favored terrains (such as the upper atmosphere) or in those with strong elemental energy (like an underground temple of a fire cult), the corresponding element might differ. If the kineticist class gains additional elements, those elements also gain corresponding terrains at the GM's discretion, and the terrakineticist chooses wild talents from those elements. A terrakineticist should almost never be in a situation that doesn't correspond to any of these elements, but in such an unusual circumstance (for instance, the void of space given the standard six elements), she loses access to all her wild talents, even her universal wild talents. When her element changes, she loses the benefits of all active wild talents from the previous element, even if it would usually last until the next time she recovers burn. However, time spent in other terrain still counts against the ability's duration; if she changes back again to the original element, the benefit returns only if it has any remaining duration.

Black Blades A black blade is a particular form of intelligent weapon gained by a magus with the bladebound archetype. There are several ways a magus might gain this weapon. Sometimes it just appears among the magus's possessions, and its origin is a mystery. Other times the magus finds a black blade during an adventure or event of some kind. Sometimes a black blade is passed down generation to generation in an ongoing search for a magus who can unlock its true potential. A black blade is always a one-handed slashing weapon, a rapier, or a sword cane. The magus chooses the blade's type upon gaining the blade, and once chosen, it can't be changed. As a bladebound magus increases in level, his black blade gains power. A black blade is independently conscious but features some personality traits reflecting its wielder. A black blade always has the same alignment as its wielder and even changes its alignment if its wielder does. The blade typically works toward its wielder's goals, but not always without argument or backlash. Each black blade has a mission, and while sometimes two or more black blades will work in concert, each mission is singular in purpose (the black blade's mission is usually up to the GM and the needs of the campaign or the adventure, or a GM can roll randomly for the weapon's purpose using the Intelligent Item Purpose table. Some black blades are very open about their missions, but most are secretive. Certain sages have speculated that an invisible hand or arcane purpose moves these weapons.

        "black blade basics": "  A black blade is bonded to a particular magus, much like a familiar, but in more of a partnership than a master-servant relationship. Intelligence : This is the intelligence score of the black blade . It starts at 10 and increases by 1 for every two levels of the bladebound magus (at 3rd level, 5th level, and so on). Wisdom and Charisma : As the bladebound magus increases in level, so do the Wisdom and Charisma of the black blade . These abilities start at 6 and increase by 1 for every two levels of magus. Ego : A black blade starts with an ego of 5, and that ego increases as the blade becomes more powerful. In cases where a wielder and the black blade come into conflict, like any intelligent item, a black blade can attempt to exert its dominance using the items against characters rules. Due to its flexible and powerful nature, a black blade has a nonstandard ego progression. Languages and Skills : A black blade starts with Common as a language. As the black blade increases in Intelligence, it manifests knowledge of languages and arcane lore. Upon reaching an Intelligence of 12, it gains a bonus language of the GM's choice, and gains 1 rank in Knowledge (arcana). Each time the sword gains a bonus to Intelligence, it gains another language and another rank in Knowledge (arcana). Senses : A black blade is aware of everything around it like a creature that can see and hear. It can be blinded and deafened as if it were a creature. It uses the saving throws of its magus, even if the magus is not currently wielding the black blade Black Blade Arcane Pool : A black blade has an arcane pool with a number of points equal to 1 + its Intelligence bonus.",
        "black blade ability descriptions": "  A black blade has special abilities (or imparts abilities to its wielder) depending on the wielder's magus level. The abilities are cumulative. A black blade normally refuses to use any of its abilities when wielded by anyone other than its magus, and acts as a masterwork weapon of its type. Alertness (Ex) : While a magus is wielding his black blade, he gains the Alertness feat. Black Blade Strike (Sp) : As a free action, the magus can spend a point from the black blade's arcane pool to grant the black blade a +1 bonus on damage rolls for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, this ability gives the black blade another +1 on damage rolls. Telepathy (Su) : While a magus is wielding or carrying his black blade , he can communicate telepathically with the blade in a language that the magus and the black blade share. Unbreakable (Ex) : As long as it has at least 1 point in its arcane pool, a black blade is immune to the broken condition. If broken, the black blade is unconscious and powerless until repaired. If destroyed, the black blade can be reforged 1 week later through a special ritual that costs 200 gp per magus level. The ritual takes 24 hours to complete. Energy Attunement (Su) : At 5th level, as a free action, a magus can spend a point of his black blade's arcane pool to have it deal one of the following types of damage instead of weapon damage: cold, electricity, or fire. He can spend 2 points from the black blade's arcane pool to deal sonic or force damage instead of weapon damage. This effect lasts until the start of the magus's next turn. Teleport Blade (Sp) : As a standard action, a magus of 9th level or higher can expend an arcane point from his or his black blade's arcane pool, and can call his black blade from as far as 1 mile away, causing it to instantaneously teleport to his hand. Transfer Arcana (Su) : At 13th level, once per day, a magus can attempt to siphon points from his black blade's arcane pool into his own arcane pool. Doing so takes a full-round action and the magus must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the black blade's ego. If the magus succeeds, he regains 1 point to his arcane pool for every 2 points he saps from his black blade . If he fails the saving throw, the magus becomes fatigued (but can try again). If he is fatigued, he becomes exhausted instead. He cannot use this ability if he is exhausted. Spell Defense (Sp) : A magus of 17th level or higher can expend an arcane point from his weapon's arcane pool as a free action; he then gains SR equal to his black blade's ego until the start of his next turn. Life Drinker (Su) : At 19th level, each time the magus kills a living creature with the black blade , he can pick one of the following effects: the black blade restores 2 points to its arcane pool; the black blade restores 1 point to its arcane pool and the magus restores 1 point to his arcane pool; the magus gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the black blade's ego (these temporary hit points last until spent or 1 minute, whichever is shorter). The creature killed must have a number of Hit Dice equal to half the magus's character level for this to occur."

While the original Ten Magic Warriors championed unusual skills drawn from various arcane spellcasting classes, often combined with martial classes or even prestige classes, the tradition today has been standardized over the course of the intervening centuries into an archetype followed strictly by magi. Even then, it's not uncommon for a Magic Warrior to multiclass with a martial class for a few levels or to become an eldritch knight to further bolster her combat powers.

      "Sigilus": {
        "source": "Adventurer's Guide pg. 59 Traditionally, the Cyphermages have harbored something of a resistance toward physical combat, preferring to rely upon the power of magic to solve problems and defeat foes. Many of the organization's traditionalists hold prejudices against those who rely upon martial skills, and this prejudice has bled over to those who mix magic with combat, such as eldritch knights and magi. With the organization's recent change to its traditions, though, its numbers have grown more welcoming of these traditions, and magic in particular, have developed a unique method of incorporating their lore. When a magus joins the ranks of the Cyphermages, she can learn the art of infusing her arcane pool with the secrets of ancient Thassilonian magic. Such an individual becomes known as a sigilus. While the mysteries of ancient Thassilon drive her spellcraft, the sigilus makes little effort to understand the academic and philosophic aspects of runes. Instead, she focuses almost entirely upon their practical application. A sigilus manipulates the discoveries of wizards and other more sagacious Cyphermages, using those findings to create special sigils that allow her to transfer spell effects into different objects for later use. Her craft builds upon traditions founded by the runelords that allowed them to infuse magic into their flesh, but rather than infusing magic into her body, the sigilus infuses it into a weapon. More interested in the exploration of Thassilonian ruins than academic research, sigiluses serve the Cyphermages by engaging in fieldwork and recovering artifacts. They work alongside more studious Cyphermages, sometimes serving as bodyguards or as regulatory agents who make sure no member gains too much power through the acquisition of potent Thassilonian secrets.",
        "inscribe rune (su)": " At 2nd level, a sigilus learns how to magically inscribe a Thassilonian rune onto a weapon. The rune to be inscribed must be chosen from the seven runes that symbolize the seven schools of Thassilonian magic (see page 63). Note that due to the nature of magus spells, certain runes (and thus certain schools of magic) are more appropriate for inscription than others-the runes for conjuration, evocation, illusion, and transmutation are the strongest choices, while those for abjuration, enchantment, and necromancy are less enticing. Inscribing a rune takes 10 minutes. Once a weapon has been infused with a rune, the sigilus becomes more adept at using her spell combat ability with spells of that rune's school. Her penalty on attack rolls when using spell combat is reduced by 1 (to -1) when she casts a spell from the same school as her inscribed rune, but is increased by 2 (to -4) when she uses spell combat with a spell not from her inscribed rune's school. As long as she has a rune inscribed on her weapon in this manner, she cannot use spells from that rune's opposition schools at all with spell combat. The sigilus can maintain only a single inscribed rune on a weapon at any time; if she inscribes a new rune on a weapon, the previously inscribed rune fades. This ability replaces spellstrike.",
        "inscribe sihedron (su)": " At 7th level, a sigilus learns to inscribe the Sihedron rune (the sevenpointed star that symbolizes all seven schools of Thassilonian magic) on a suit of light armor she wears. When she does so, her armor becomes physically empowered with defensive magic, granting her energy resistance 5 to two energy types of her choice selected from acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic, and increasing the armor's armor bonus by 1. (Note that this increase is an armor bonus increase, and thus stacks with any enhancement bonus a suit of magic light armor may have.) Inscribing the Sihedron rune in this way becomes part of the sigilus's spell preparation ritual-she can inscribe a Sihedron rune in this way once per day as a result. Each day she inscribes the Sihedron rune, she can change the two types of energy resistance it grants as she wishes. At 13th level, an inscribed Sihedron rune grants energy resistance 10 to one energy type and energy resistance 5 to two other energy types, and its armor bonus increases to +2. A Sihedron rune can be inscribed only on light armor-it cannot be inscribed on medium or heavy armor, even if the magus later gains proficiency with medium or heavy armor. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor."

        "kami channeler (su)": "  A kami medium channels the kami at locations different from where a normal medium channels his spirits. The kami medium channels the dosojin (which acts as the trickster) at crossroads and other major roadway milestones; the fukujin (which acts as the marshal) at ornamental shrubs and bonsai trees; the kaminari (which acts as the champion) in the midst of storms; the suijin (which acts as the hierophant) at pure lakes, ponds, springs, and wells; and the zuishin (which acts as the guardian) at significant gates, doorways, and torii. The kami medium does not have access to the archmage legend. This ability alters spirit.",
        "natural taboo (ex)": "  A kami medium gains the taboo ability at 1st level. Regardless of which kami he channels, each day he must accept the hierophant taboo to strongly revere nature and avoid metal armor. The kami medium gains two free uses of spirit surge from accepting this taboo, as normal. This ability alters taboo.",
        "ofuda (su)": "  A kami medium uses ofudas-psychically charged prayer scrolls-to focus his spells. Each of his spells gains an ofuda as an additional inexpensive material component, and the ofuda replaces the divine focus for spells the kami medium gains via the divine surge spirit power. Unless the spell involves a touch attack or ranged touch attack, the kami medium doesn't need to attempt an attack roll to place an ofuda on an unwilling target; the ofuda simply appears on affected targets. For instantaneous spells, the ofuda is consumed during the casting, but for spells with any other duration, the ofuda remains on the target or targets throughout the duration and then disintegrates when the duration expires. A kami medium's spells can't be dispelled by dispel magic or greater dispel magic , but removing or destroying the ofuda ends the duration immediately. An ofuda must be displayed prominently and can't be hidden (though a creature bearing an ofuda can hide normally). A successful steal or grapple combat maneuver check to remove an item is sufficient to remove an ofuda from an unwilling target, and a standard action automatically removes it from a willing target. An ofuda counts as an object made of paper with 5 hit points per medium level. The target of the spell can't see, harm, or remove the ofuda attached to her, though her allies can do so. If the spell is harmless, the target can see her ofuda. This ability alters the medium's spellcasting.",

Initially, the merged minor shikigami can't leave the paper body and acts in all ways as an ordinary animal familiar of the origami animal's type, although it still appears to be made of paper. At 5th level, it gains the abilities of a shikigami improved familiar ( Bestiary 3 163), even if the kami medium doesn't meet the prerequisites for having a shikigami as a familiar. The shikigami treats the kami medium as its ward. Additionally, it gains the ability to use change shape to change between its full shikigami form and its origami form at will (as beast shape II ).

This ability replaces ask the spirits.",

This grants the kami medium the ward and merge with ward abilities of the kami subtype. For large areas such as lakes or storms, a kami medium's ward encompasses a radius of up to 5 feet per medium level. This ability replaces astral journey."

Uses of analyze dweomer cost him 5-minute increments instead of 1-minute increments, and he can use the read aura occult skill unlock with his third eye multiple times per day; each use takes only 1 minute but costs 5 minutes of the duration he can keep his third eye open.

His alignment must be within one step of the outsider's alignment in order to choose it, and once chosen it cannot be changed. Instead of channeling spirits, an outer channeler invokes outsiders of his chosen subtype during his seance. Each subtype lists six outsiders that, when invoked, provide the outer channeler with the same benefits as the outsider's associated spirit. For example, an outer channeler with angel as his chosen subtype can invoke the astral deva, balisse, empyrean, movanic deva, planetar, and solar outsiders, which function like the trickster, hierophant, archmage, champion, marshal, and guardian spirits, respectively. An outer channeler doesn't gain the intermediate power normally granted by his invoked outsider's associated spirit. Instead, he gains the intermediate power noted in his invoked outsider's subtype, regardless of which spirit that invoked outsider is associated with. Furthermore, the outer channeler gains a gift at 13th level, as noted in his invoked outsider subtype. An invoked outsider acts as a spirit for all other effects, including the trance of three and astral beacon class features. This ability alters spirit and spirit power (intermediate).",
        "taboo (ex)": " Whenever he invokes an outsider, an outer channeler must accept one taboo from among those listed by his chosen outsider's subtype before the outsider will enter his body. Accepting this taboo provides the outer channeler with no benefits other than those gained from channeling a spirit; if he wishes to gain additional uses of his spirit purge ability as described by the taboo class feature, he must accept a second taboo from among those listed by the legend that his chosen outsider subtype functions as. If the outer channeler breaks this mandatory taboo, the outsider immediately leaves and the outer channeler can't invoke a new outsider until he atones (as per atonement ). This ability alters taboo.",

At 7th level, the animal transforms into an outsider, taking the form of an improved familiar with the outer channeler's chosen outsider subtype (such as a cassisian for an angel-invoking medium). The outer channeler doesn't need to meet the prerequisites to gain this improved familiar, and the improved familiar gains the ability to change shape between its outsider form and its animal form at will (as per beast shape II ). This ability replaces a medium's haunt channeler and connection channel.",

This is in addition to the usual list of sites from which he can channel his outsiders. This ability replaces location channel.",

        "channel self (su)": "  A reanimated medium is essentially a bodiless spirit using influence to possess his own spiritless body. 'The reanimated medium' refers to this spirit. Unlike a normal medium, a reanimated medium becomes more powerful the more influence it has over its body. Each day, the reanimated medium can perform a seance at a location as normal to focus on one of his potential future legends. He channels that legendary potential as strongly as possible into his body. The spirit gains 3 points of influence over his body, to a maximum of 6 points. Since he is his own possessing spirit, he doesn't lose control at 5 or more points of influence, though he still suffers the legend's influence penalty as normal at 3 or more points of influence. All effects and abilities that normally increase or decrease influence (such as spirit surge and spirit powers) have the opposite effect on a reanimated medium (for instance, propitiation increases influence by 1 point and spirit surge reduces influence by 1 point); this does not apply to the new abilities from the reanimated medium archetype. A reanimated medium can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to avoid losing influence from using spirit surge. The body of a reanimated medium who reaches 0 points of influence enters a deathlike coma and is helpless for 24 hours, after which the reanimated medium reverts to 1 point of influence if the body is still alive, but can't perform a seance for another 24 hours. A character who selects the reanimated medium archetype after 1st level can do so only after dying; at the GM's discretion, a dead character of another class with an intact body who has earned enough experience points to level up can take a level in medium and gain the reanimated medium archetype, and a dead medium might be able to gain this archetype. In any case, being revived from gaining the reanimated medium archetype does not impart any negative levels or other ill effects. This ability alters spirit.",

If the reanimated medium died of hit point damage, healing works on his body during the intervening round and can bring him back to life. Once the spirit departs, the breath of life spell continues to work for 1 additional round, even though the reanimated medium has been dead for more than 1 round. This ability replaces location channel.",
        "spirit warding (su)": "  At 7th level, the reanimated medium can ward himself from other spirits and the grave's call. He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against possession, death effects, and negative energy. This stacks with the bonus to resist possession that mediums gain from having high influence. At 18th level, he becomes immune to possession, death effects, and negative energy. This ability replaces connection channel and spacious soul.",
        "living legend (su)": "  At 20th level, the reanimated medium reaches the legendary potential from which he borrowed so long ago and becomes a living embodiment of his legend. Any ally in the reanimated medium's presence can perform a seance to channel the reanimated medium (the seance takes 1 hour and is subject to the other rules for a medium's seance). Each ally can do this only once per day. At the end of the seance, the reanimated medium can choose to reduce his influence by 1 point. If the reanimated medium does so, some of his spirit seeps into that ally, which can then spend that 1 point of influence to use any of the reanimated medium's abilities that decrease influence.

Once a relic channeler selects a choice for taboos and spirit powers (such as archmage arcana and legendary champion), those choices remain in effect every time she channels that legend; unlike normal mediums, she can't select a different option each time. A relic channeler can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce her influence from spirit surge. She doesn't need to find an appropriate location to channel her spirits, since she can simply use her relics. If she loses one of her relics, she is incapable of channeling that legend until she recovers the relic. If the relic is destroyed, the relic channeler can use her strong bond with the spirit of that relic to forge a new relic for that spirit from her own essence.

They serve as spiritual advisors for the organization, and are valued for the lore and wisdom they gain during their trances. During such a trance, a single storm dreamer can easily protect and defend a temple-or at the very least, provide suitably threatening defensive displays. Mediums who become storm dreamers select their spirits normally, but the spirits with which they bond are supernatural remnants of the first Storm Kindlers- those reckless explorers who established the tradition but succumbed to their own arrogance and were consumed by the Eye of Abendego. Some storm dreamers, though, become incapable of retaining their own personality and values, and transform into unpredictable forces of nature. Storm dreamers refer to this condition as being 'stormcursed' and view these lost brothers and sisters with a mix of pity and horror. The stormcursed do not maintain ties with the Storm Kindlers, and in many cases their departure from the organization is violent and destructive. They are not viewed as heretics of Gozreh by the Storm Kindlers, but neither are they sought after as allies. They are typically treated as dangerous and unpredictable agents of the storm and allowed to dwell in relative peace in the remote locations where the stormcursed dreamers choose to dwell in. The exact cause of this condition is hotly debated among the storm dreamers themselves, for it seems to afflict their members almost randomly. Some believe these storm dreamers brushed too close to the 'slumbering mind' of the Eye of Abendego, while others theorize that the mediums' souls simply got pulled away and replaced with some of the half-mad fragments the dreamers speak to in trance. The truth, whatever it is, may never be fully understood.",

When determining the effect of the granted power, the storm dreamer's effective cleric level is equal to her storm dreamer level.

Entering the trance is a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, but once in a storm trance, the storm dreamer can maintain the trance as a free action for a number of minutes per day equal to her storm dreamer class level + her Charisma modifier. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. While in a storm trance, the storm dreamer gains energy resistance 5 against cold and electricity, treats wind as one step less severe, and gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on all saving throws against wind effects, spells with the air or electricity descriptors, and effects that deal electricity damage. This ability replaces haunt channeler.",

Each time she casts one of these spell-like abilities, she reduces the number of remaining minutes for her storm trance by 1 minute; she can't use these spell-like abilities if she has less than 1 minute remaining for the day to use her storm trance. This ability replaces location channel.",

This functions like channeling a spirit, except instead of requiring a favored location to channel a wendo, an uda wendo must offer the wendo a sacrifice worth at least 50 gp per Hit Die the uda wendo has. Alternatively, the uda wendo can instead accept 1 point of burn, as per the kineticist class ability ( Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 11 ), instead of sacrificing material wealth. While channeling a wendo, the uda wendo gains the 1st-level domain power of one druid animal or terrain domain (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 33), or the 1st-level domain power of one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Community, Darkness, Death, Destruction, Earth, Fire, Healing, Knowledge, Protection, Rune, Strength, Sun, Trickery, War, Water, or Weather. The uda wendo has an effective cleric or druid level equal to 1/2 his medium level (minimum 1st) for the purpose of this ability. In addition, he adds all spells from his chosen domain that are of a spell level he can cast (including modifications to the uda wendo's spellcasting from the archmage arcana or divine surge lesser spirit powers) to his medium spell list and medium spells known as medium spells of their domain spell level. An uda wendo cannot invite allies to a seance to summon a wendo, and by channeling a wendo, the uda wendo allows the entity to gain 2 points of inf luence over him. If any sentient creature that doesn't practice juju witnesses the uda wendo's seance, both creatures become permanently cursed with a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks (as per bestow curse) and the attempt fails. This ability alters spirit.",

A vessel of the failed intimately understands the shaky line between success and failure and embraces walking that line to gain power from the spirits he calls.",
        "will of the failed (su)": " A vessel of the failed is intimately familiar with the supernatural stubbornness of the brash heroes who have met their demise pursuing the Test of the Starstone, and he can tap into this strength when he needs it the most. When a spirit attains 5 or more points of influence over the vessel of the failed, the vessel can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + half the vessel's class level) to avoid completely losing control to the spirit. The first time in a single 24-hour seance period that the vessel succeeds at this saving throw, he is deafened until he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. The second time the vessel succeeds at this saving throw during that period, he is also blinded. The third time, he is also staggered. These conditions are unavoidable and cannot be removed through magic or any other method. (If he wishes, the vessel of the failed can choose to forgo this saving throw and lose control to the spirit as normal.) The fourth time in a single seance period that a spirit gains 5 or more influence points over the vessel of the failed, the vessel must succeed at a Will save or he loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. If a spirit ever attains 7 or more points of influence over the vessel, the vessel automatically loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. A vessel of the failed cannot channel a weaker spirit. This alters spirit and spirit mastery.",

If the vessel allows his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him after failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, there is a 75% chance (1-75 on a d%) that he can add 3d6 to the check's result without taking an action. (At 10th level, these dice increase to 3d8, and at 20th level, they increase to 3d10.) However, there is a 25% chance (76-100 on a d%) that the vessel instead gains no bonus from this ability. The vessel of the failed must allow his spirit to gain the 2 points of influence over him before determining whether he receives any bonus. The vessel of the failed can use the spirit surge ability as normal. However, using reckless surge in the way described above always requires the vessel to allow his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him, regardless of abilities that allow him to otherwise use spirit surge without incurring influence (such as taboo or spirit mastery). This alters spirit surge.",
        "heroic exceptions (ex)": " Each time a vessel of the failed breaks a taboo he has accepted, he can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him. When he does so, the penalty he takes on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws changes from -2 to -1. This influence is in addition to the influence the spirit normally gains for breaking the taboo in the first place. If the vessel continues violating the taboo while taking a reduced penalty, the duration of the reduced penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the vessel. This alters taboo.",
        "spiritual swan song (sp)": " At 15th level, when the circumstances are right, the vessel of the failed can become a conduit for his spirit's brush with divinity. Whenever the vessel makes a successful saving throw via the will of the failed ability to avoid completely losing control to his spirit, the vessel gains one use of a spell-like ability tied to the spirit's legend, as noted below. When he gains a use of a spell-like ability, the vessel of the failed can expend it anytime before his next seance. (A vessel might gain multiple uses of these spell-like abilities, depending on how many times he successfully saves to avoid losing control to a spirit.) However, if he loses contact with a spirit during that time, he also loses all uses of the spell-like ability gained from avoiding losing control to that spirit. If the vessel does not expend his uses of these abilities, they disappear when he loses contact with that spirit or when he starts a new seance, whichever comes first. This replaces trance of three. Archmage : The vessel of the failed can cast chain lightning , freezing sphere , or sirocco as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which one when he gains a use of this ability. If he gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, the vessel of the failed can make a different choice each time. Champion : The vessel of the failed can cast blade barrier as a spell-like ability. Guardian : The vessel of the failed can cast antimagic field as a spell-like ability. Hierophant : The vessel of the failed can cast mass cure moderate wounds or mass inflict moderate wounds as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which of these two he can use when he gains a use of this ability. If the vessel of the failed gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, he can choose a difference spell-like ability each time. Marshal : The vessel of the failed can cast greater heroism as a spell-like ability. Trickster : The vessel of the failed can cast true seeing as a spell-like ability."

They originate in a place that no mortal mind can comprehend, and their power merely passes through the astral realm to reach the medium. For each point of influence an emissary gains over a medium, the medium takes a -1 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdombased skill checks, in addition to the other penalties imposed by the emissary's influence. If an emissary gains enough influence to take control of him, when the medium awakens, in addition to performing the bidding of the alien entity, he retains faint memories of horrible things in dark places and takes 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. This ability alters spirit.",
        "surge of the void (su)": " The voice of the void can use spirit surge additional times per day without incurring influence, but each time he does, he is confused for 1 round. If this confusion would cause him to babble, he can instead act normally, but his emissary gains 1 point of influence over him. The voice of the void can't use this ability if he is immune to confusion, but he can remove the confused condition when he is affected by it. This temporary confusion clearly indicates the voice of the void isn't fully in control, so if he uses this power on a Diplomacy check in a negotiation, for example, it might prejudice the other party against him regardless of his check result. This ability modifies spirit surge.",
        "blasphemy (ex)": " Emissaries demand that a medium perform acts appealing to their alien whims. These work just like taboos for an ordinary medium, but in addition to the base taboo, they require bizarre and alien acts that distance the voice of the void from his own humanity. These blasphemies cause the medium to take a -1 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks whenever he accepts a taboo. The increased devotion required to maintain a blasphemy reaps a greater reward, however. If the voice of the void is under a blasphemy, the die for his spirit surge changes from 1d6 to 1d8, increasing to 1d10 at 10th level and 1d12 at 20th level. This ability alters taboo.",
        "void channeler (su)": " At 3rd level, the voice of the void can funnel energy from the emissaries' realm through himself. A number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier, the medium can unleash a burst of energy that damages all other creatures except aberrations within 30 feet of him. The burst deals 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 additional points of damage for every 2 medium levels the medium has beyond 3rd. Creatures receive a Will save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the medium's level + the medium's Charisma modifier). Creatures with fewer HD than half the medium's level who fail the Will save are also confused for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces haunt channeler."

All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty becomes -3 at 8th level. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect. This replaces hypnotic stare, painful stare, and towering ego.",

These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The aromaphile can't choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted. This replaces bold stare.",

This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions. An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target's emotions (as per calm emotions ). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber , except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile's level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile's level + the aromaphile's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile's level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.

Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has. An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending. This ability alters hypnotic stare.",
        "wide stare (su)": " At 5th level, whenever an autohypnotist is focusing his stare on a foe, he can broaden his hypnotic stare as a standard action.

She loses both benefits when under an effect that would prevent her from providing an emotion component ( Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144 ). This replaces towering ego.",
        "touch of night (su)": " A dreamstalker can't remove shaken, frightened, sickened, cowering, nauseated, or panicked conditions using her touch treatment. However, she can remove fatigue or magical sleep (other than hard-to-remove magical sleep such as the eternal slumber APG hex) as a minor condition, staggered as a moderate condition, and exhausted as a greater condition. As normal, removing fatigue or exhaustion only removes the condition, not the underlying cause, such as lack of sleep. This ability alters touch treatment.",

While in a dreamscape, she also treats any creature from the Dimension of Dreams (including dreamed figments) as her favored enemy, with a bonus equal to 1/2 her favored terrain bonus.

Enigmas often end up serving as master spies and infiltration experts.",
        "solipsism (su)": " At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature's saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature's view. Until the enigma's next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma's next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility , it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma's hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma's hypnotic stare always has a penalty of -1. This ability alters hypnotic stare.",

This ability functions as the touch treatment ability, but can only be used to remove harmful conditions from the enigma, not other creatures. In order to remove these harmful effects, the enigma must succeed at a touch attack against another creature. The creature touched gains the chosen harmful effect for whatever duration it would have afflicted the enigma and the effect is removed from the enigma, unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the enigma's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier). Using this ability is always a standard action. At 14th level, the enigma can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of bestow curse, delivered as a touch attack as part of using this ability. Transfer affliction is a mind-affecting effect. This ability alters touch treatment.",

        "detection void (su)": " At 11th level, an enigma can elude detection spells (spells with 'detect' in their name). A creature using this sort of magic against the enigma must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the enigma's class level to succeed (as if the enigma was under the effect of a nondetection spell); failure means the magic fails to detect the enigma, as if he did not exist. This ability replaces glib lie.",
        "absentia (su)": " At 20th level, all creatures adjacent to the enigma subconsciously ignore him. Adjacent creatures are always treated as flat-footed to the enigma and are not considered to be directly observing the enigma for the purpose of the Stealth skill. This effect ends immediately if the enigma makes a successful attack against any creature, but automatically resumes at the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces rule minds."

        "eyeball familiar (ex)": " An eyebiter imbues one of his eyes with limited sentience, so that he can pluck it out and allow it to move on its own. The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 17 ) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn't resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and a Constitution score of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master's when a familiar normally would. It doesn't grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar. Whenever the eyebiter's eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration ). An eyebiter must have at least one eye to use this ability, and an eyebiter with only one eye is blinded instead of dazzled until his familiar returns. This ability replaces consummate liar and the mesmerist trick gained at 1st level.",
        "ocular occlusion (su)": " At 3rd level, an eyebiter gains the ability to cloud the sight of others with a melee touch attack. He can use this ability as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A successful Will save negates the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eyebiter's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier); this is a mind-affecting ability. If the eyebiter chooses to use an ocular occlusion of a lower level than the highest-level effect he has gained, he can instead use a standard action to target a creature within 30 feet with that effect as a ranged touch attack. Clouded Vision : At 3rd level, the eyebiter can cause the target to become dazzled for 1 minute and suffer a 20% miss chance on all attacks the target makes against opponents within 60 feet. Opponents more than 60 feet away have total concealment from the target. Cause or Cure Blindness : At 6th level, the eyebiter can blind the target for 1 minute or affect it as per the spells remove blindness Eyeless Horror : At 10th level, the eyebiter creates a powerful illusion that causes the target's eyes to appear as if they have been ripped out, with blood pouring from the sockets. The target is blinded and shaken for 1 round per the eyebiter's mesmerist level, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage each round. The target can attempt a second Will save when attacked to negate the shaken effect and the nonlethal damage. Spellblight : At 14th level, the eyebiter can afflict the target with the ebon eyes, the eldritch cataracts, or the hemoculysis spellblight ( Ultimate Magic 95 ). This ability replaces all instances of touch treatment.",
        "staring eye (su)": " At 5th level, an eyebiter can expend one use of his daily mesmerist tricks to either see through his eyeball familiar as if it were an arcane eye, or to use his hypnotic stare (including related abilities like painful stare and bold stare), as well as any gaze attack he possesses (like burning gaze and eyebite) through his eyeball familiar, as if he were at its location. This ability replaces mental potency.",
        "omnivisual (ex)": " At 11th level, an eyebiter's roving eyeball familiar is constantly watching in all directions. As long as his eyeball familiar is outside his body and near enough to see the same things (such as being in the same room), the eyebiter gains all-around vision ( Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 294 ) and cannot be flanked.

This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn't change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster's mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature's lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities. This alters the mesmerist's spellcasting.",
        "feytouched (ex)": " At 2nd level, a fey trickster's time with the fey has granted her strange powers, as well as resistance to further fey mischief. The fey trickster gains the druid's resist nature's lure and woodland stride abilities, and she counts as both fey and her original creature type for the purpose of spells and effects. This ability replaces towering ego.",
        "fey veil (sp, su)": " At 3rd level, a fey trickster's physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. At 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally's form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self , but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn't allow a saving throw to disbelieve). At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projection OA . At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature. This ability replaces touch treatment.",
        "one with the fey": " At 20th level, a fey trickster fully transforms into a fey, though she can still choose to count as her original creature type as well whenever it would be advantageous to her (such as if she is a humanoid and wishes to be affected by reduce person). She gains low-light vision as well as an additional ability depending on which type of fey she chooses to most closely associate with. Some examples follow. Erlking : The fey trickster is constantly under the effects of haste Nymph : The fey trickster gains the nymph's unearthly grace ability ( Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 217 ) Quickling : The fey trickster gains the quickling's supernatural speed ability ( Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227 ). Rusalka : The fey trickster gains the rusalka's tresses ability and four tress primary natural attacks similar to those of a rusalka ( Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 232 ).

A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty Trick APG and Greater Dirty Trick APG without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite. This ability replaces consummate liar.",
        "horrid mask (su)": " At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter's Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.",
        "phantasmal force (su)": " At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes. This ability replaces touch treatment (moderate).",
        "phantasmal foes (su)": " At 10th level, a gaslighter can spend one use of his horrid mask ability as a standard action to convince the target of his hypnotic stare that it is surrounded by foes only it can see. The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type. This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.",

He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of 'personal' and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn't realize the hatemonger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal.

He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target's height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target's type and size category ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169 ). At 6th level, he can adjust the target's gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target's type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target's age, rewinding the target's age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn't confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target's type or subtype, as per polymorph . At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target's type as per greater polymorph . This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect-for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph . At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action. Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect-gear does not resize to suit the wearer's new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer's space. This ability replaces touch treatment and rule minds."

The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time-upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the 'filling an image with your consciousness' use of the enter image spell ( Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 219 ). Use the projectionist's mesmerist level as the spell's caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness. Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.

The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2  x the spirit walker's class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can't be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker's class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target's body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate ) or restored to life.

A creature that fails its save but has more than 20 HD suffers the effect of command undead . A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected by master of the dead for 24 hours. A spirit walker can control only one undead creature in this fashion at a time. If he permanently controls a new undead creature, the previous one is set free. This ability replaces rule minds."

The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it. Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a -2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican's class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes -3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn't prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection. If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again-once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping. The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches' evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.

The toxitician can't choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn't have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician's class level + the toxitician's Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2. Ability Decrease : The target takes a -2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician's choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4. Excruciating : The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses. Fortitude Decrease : The target's immune system weakens, imposing a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4. Natural Armor Decrease : The target's skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4. Reflex Decrease : The target's body becomes stiffer, imposing a -2 penalty on the target's Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4. Slow : The target's actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a -1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes -2.

The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration .) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist's mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist's Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadow UM descriptor. A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature's normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time. At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level).

Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint's benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil's next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint's effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil's class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can't choose the same dazzling feint more than once. Blinding Strike : The vexing daredevil's weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent's eyes. If the vexing daredevil's next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round. Combat Maneuver : The vexing daredevil's attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil's next attack. Critical Strike : Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target's weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses. Outmanuever : The vexing daredevil's darting movements foil the target's attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target's space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action.

Piercing Strike : By psychically amplifying the target's pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s. Sloppy Defense : The vexing daredevil's attacks effortlessly penetrate the target's defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses. Surprise Strike : The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus - 5 as a free action.

Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier's abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier's hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack. At 3rd level, the vizier automatically gains the susceptibility bold stare improvement, and it also applies to the DCs of any influence check to manipulate the target (even if it isn't Diplomacy or Intimidate). This ability replaces consummate liar and the bold stare improvement gained at 3rd level.",
        "power behind the throne (su)": " At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn't contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier's spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers' memories and perception of the spell's casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier's allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell's casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally's implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own. At 5th level, the vizier doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calm UC . A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier's illusion of calm for 24 hours. This ability replaces towering ego and mental potency."

Unlike most psychic spells, a vox's mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells.

A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox's voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence).

        "source": "Heroes of the High Court pg. 22 The invested regent has been handpicked by inscrutable divine forces to command others-either at the present or at some future time. The invested regent can harness a divine spark to perform superhuman stunts, influence others, and escape injury. Invested regents come from all races and walks of life, but they are more likely to be nobleborn in their cultures. Although some invested regents are acutely aware of their powers' divine origins (such as powers gained from an investment ceremony to Asmodeus in the nation of Cheliax), others do not know the source of their abilities. Invested regents have strong personalities and a destiny to rule.",
        "investiture (su)": " An invested regent gains a pool of investiture points, supernatural energy he can use to call upon amazing abilities and divine protection. The number of points in the invested regent's investiture pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Charisma modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his investiture pool, the invested regent can select one of his saving throws as a swift action and gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws of that type for 1 round. If he spends 1 point from his investiture pool during this swift action, he instead gains a sacred bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on the saving throw selected. A character with this feature and the ki pool class feature tracks investiture points and ki points separately. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.",

This replaces the bonus feat the invested regent gives up for the vested power.",
        "vested powers": " Vested powers are abilities that draw on an invested regent's investiture pool. Vested powers are divided into two categories: feats and spells. Requirements: All vested powers have a minimum level requirement to select them. An invested regent who hasn't reached the required monk level cannot select that vested power. Activation: Most vested powers require the invested regent to spend investiture points; the exact amount is listed after the vested power. Vested powers that cost 0 investiture points don't require the invested regent to have any investiture points in his investiture pool to use the ability. The saving throw against an invested regent's vested power, if any, is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invested regent's monk level + his Charisma bonus. Feats: These vested powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. An invested regent doesn't need to qualify for a feat to select it as a vested power. For example, an invested regent can select Spring Attack as a vested power even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these vested powers is a free action on the invested regent's turn; until the start of his next turn, the invested regent is treated as if he had that feat. Feats marked with an asterisk (*) can also be activated as an immediate action when it isn't the invested regent's turn. Spells: These vested powers duplicate the effects of a spell and are spell-like abilities. An invested regent's monk level is the caster level for these spell-like abilities, and he uses Charisma to determine his concentration check bonus. Activating one of these vested powers is a standard action.",

For example, a monk can spend 2 points of ki to give his improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus and the ki focus quality, or just the flaming burst quality.

The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the monk makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces abundant step.",

The monk must abide by the alignment restrictions of the aspect. If the monk ever changes his alignment to something outside the aspect's alignment restrictions, he loses this ability and cannot regain it unless his alignment later changes again to match that of the aspect. This ability replaces timeless body. Aspect of the Carp : The monk's skin becomes a coat of golden, iridescent fish scales, his neck grows gills, and his fingers become webbed. He can breathe water and gains a swim speed equal to his land speed. The carp is heroic and adventurous-a monk must be nonevil to take on the aspect of the carp. Aspect of the Ki-Rin : The monk's skin takes on a golden luminescence, and a silvery mane that cannot be bound grows atop his head. He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed, but he must end each turn on the ground. If the monk does not land by the end of his turn, he falls from whatever height he has attained. The ki-rin is honorable, honest, and self-sacrificing-a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the ki-rin. Aspect of the Monkey : The monk's face becomes that of a monkey, and he grows a prehensile tail. The monk can pick up objects and make unarmed attacks with his tail (though the tail does not grant additional unarmed attacks or natural attacks). In addition, the monk gains a climb speed equal to his land speed. The monkey is a creature of whimsy and a lover of pranks-a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the monkey. Aspect of the Oni : The monk's skin becomes pitch black, and his hair turns white, black, red, or violet. He can assume gaseous form (as the spell) as a standard action for 1 minute per day per monk level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it hungers for the pain and death of living creatures-a monk must be evil to take on the aspect of the oni. Aspect of the Owl : The monk grows feathers, and his head becomes avian, with wide, unblinking eyes. He gains a fly speed of 30 feet. The owl is a sage creature, deeply serious, and driven toward a single goal-a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the owl. Aspect of the Tiger : Dark stripes appear on the monk's skin, and his face becomes more feline. His eyes become catlike, with vertical pupils, and his canines enlarge. Once per hour, the monk can move at 10 times his normal land speed when he makes a charge and is treated as if he had the pounce ability. The tiger is swift, fierce, and deadly-a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the tiger.",

When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a wish or miracle spell or by the power of a deity.

When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability replaces abundant step.",

The monk can use touch of peace once per day, and must announce his intent before making his attack roll. On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per level.

This replaces the monk class ability the qinggong monk gives up for this ki power. Ki Powers Ki powers are abilities that draw on the power of a monk's ki. The standard monk has several abilities that count as ki powers, such as wholeness of body, abundant step, and empty body. A qinggong monk can learn additional ki powers, which often replaces a non-ki monk ability such as purity of body. Ki powers are divided into three categories: feats, monk abilities, and spells. Feats : These ki powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. A monk does not need to qualify for a feat to select it as a ki power. For example, a qinggong monk can select Spring Attack as a ki power even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these ki powers is a free action on the monk's turn; until the start of her next turn, the monk is treated as if she had that feat. Some of these ki powers that duplicate feats may also be activated as an immediate action; these powers are noted in the ki powers list. Monk Abilities : Some ki powers are standard monk abilities.

      "Scarred Monk": {
        "source": "Horror Realms pg. 12 Scarred monks find unique clarity in physical discomfort. For monks who seek the truth hidden in pain, the practice of mortifications of the flesh helps to achieve enlightenment and acquire disturbing powers. Those who worship Zon-Kuthon tend to be particularly eager to explore the limitations of the flesh, yet monks of his faith are not the only ones to use self-mutilation and scarification to seek personal enhancement and power.",
        "mortifications (su)": " Detailed below are a number of unusual, grisly, and harrowing processes known as mortifications that a monk can inflict upon herself in exchange for an unusual ki power. The monk must adhere to a philosophy that finds power in self-mortification; among the deities of the Inner Sea region, Zon-Kuthon's devoted are the most associated with this practice, but other lawful faiths, such as those dedicated to the empyreal lords Neshen and Vildeis, the infernal duke Zaebos, or the whore queen Doloras, count mortifications among their approved methods of self-enlightenment. While mortal followers of the mysterious kyton demagogues are rare in the Inner Sea region, the kytons also encourage their monk worshipers to invest deeply in mortifications. A scarred monk chooses her first mortification at 4th level, selecting one from the list of potential mortifications detailed below. The scarred monk gains another mortification every 3 monk levels after this, to a maximum of six mortifications at 19th level. Once a scarred monk selects a mortification, she cannot change it. Some mortifications have prerequisites, such as already knowing certain mortifications or attaining a specific level (as noted in their descriptions). Unless otherwise stated, a scarred monk cannot select an individual mortification more than once. When a scarred monk gains her first mortification, she gains a number of ki points equal to 1/2 her monk level + her Wisdom modifier. These ki points can only be spent to activate powers granted from mortifications or to make ki strikes. A scarred monk cannot spend ki points to make an additional attack at her highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows, to increase her base speed, or to give herself a +4 dodge bonus to AC, nor can she use any of the other powers normally granted to monks that utilize their ki pools. Mortifications alter the ki pool and replace high jump, wholeness of body, abundant step, and empty body. Armor of Scars (Su) : A scarred monk can force ki into her extensive scars, hardening them like armor. Provided she has at least 1 ki point in her pool, she gains a +1 bonus to her natural armor. A scarred monk can take this mortification multiple times; its effects stack. Blood Eagle (Su) : The monk's rib bones are unusually prominent and press hideously against the flesh of her chest. As a swift action, she can spend 1 ki point to cause her ribs to break through her flesh, lacerating and tearing any opponent that has engaged her in a grapple attack or that has swallowed her whole. This does not cause the monk any damage; a few seconds after she extrudes them, the ribs retract into her body, leaving behind angry red welts. The ribs deal an amount of slashing damage equal to her base unarmed strike damage to any creature that is currently grappling her or has swallowed her whole. If the monk attempts to escape from that grapple in the same round, she adds the amount of damage her ribs inflicted to her Escape Artist or CMB check as a circumstance bonus. Contortionist (Su) : Over the years, the scarred monk has broken many of her bones and reset them at odd and repulsive angles to allow her to contort into entirely unnatural forms. The monk can spend 1 ki point as a free action to gain a +20 circumstance bonus on any Escape Artist check. Doll Face (Su) : When acquiring a new face with the face collector mortification (see below), the scarred monk can spend an additional 2 ki points to perform an eerie blood ritual that gives the stolen flesh the appearance of aged ceramic. When the face is stitched to her flesh, the monk gains the appearance of an aged porcelain doll, complete with cracked and peeling paint and a glassy, unblinking stare. A scarred monk with a doll face does not gain the bonus on Disguise checks but does gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per hour, the scarred monk can cause the doll face to shift and appear as the face of a lost loved one or friend of a single viewer within 30 feet-that targeted individual must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the scarred monk's monk level + the scarred monk's Charisma modifier) or become nauseated with fear for a number of rounds equal to the number of mortifications the scarred monk has. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Unlike a face of flesh, a doll face ages and cracks, falling off and restoring the scarred monk's true and deformed face after 24 hours. A scarred monk must have the face collector mortification to take this mortification. Eyes Stitched Shut (Su) : The scarred monk can stitch her eyes shut. This takes 1 minute to accomplish, after which the monk is effectively blind. However, as long as the monk retains at least 1 point in her ki pool, she gains blindsense to a distance of 60 feet. She can detect living creatures with at least 1 point of damage within 30 feet of her as if via blindsight. The monk can remove the stitches as a full-round action to restore her normal sight and end this effect. Face Collector (Su) : This mortification requires a monk to surgically remove the flesh from her face, surrendering her appearance and all associated identity. The flesh of her face heals into a featureless mass of scars at the end of this surgical ritual. Thereafter, at the cost of 1 ki point and as a standard action, the scarred monk can alter her facial features to duplicate those of a dead body she touches. The body must be of the same creature type as the scarred monk, and as her face changes, the corpse's face withers away into rot and decay. This grants the scarred monk a +8 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual (although the penalties for gender, race, age, and size still apply). As a side effect to this unnatural shifting of appearance, a scarred monk gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against scrying effects. For 24 hours after claiming a new face, this bonus increases to +4. Pain Binding (Su) : By spending 1 ki point when she makes a single unarmed strike against a living creature as a standard action, the scarred monk can link her own pain to the creature struck. For a number of rounds equal to the total number of mortifications the scarred monk has, any time the scarred monk takes lethal damage, the creature she has bound her pain to must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Charisma modifier) or take an equal amount of nonlethal damage. The effects of pain binding end immediately once the pain-bound creature falls unconscious. Rings of Pain (Su) : The scarred monk has pierced her flesh with numerous large metal rings. As a standard action and at the cost of 2 ki points, she can tear one of these piercings free from her flesh to flood her body with searing pain. As she does so, she exudes waves of agony in a 30-foot radius to deal damage equal to twice the monk's unarmed strike modified by twice her Wisdom modifier to all creatures in the area of effect. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + her Wisdom modifier) halves the damage, but on a failed Will save, a creature is sickened by the pain for 1 round. A scarred monk must be at least 10th level to take this mortification. Share Pain (Su) : Whenever the monk takes damage from a weapon, she can spend 1 ki point as an immediate action to cause the body of her attacker to suffer the pain of that blow. The attacking creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier) or take damage equal to the amount the weapon blow inflicted on the monk and become staggered from the pain for 1 round as well. A successful saving throw halves the damage the attacker suffers from shared pain and negates the staggered effect. Third Eye (Su) : The scarred monk bores a hole in her brow and then implants a mummified or alchemically preserved third eye in this opening. The third eye must come from a creature of the same size and creature type as the scarred monk. The scarred monk can then spend 1 ki point to gain true seeing , as per the spell, for 1 round. A scarred monk must be at least 13th level to take this mortification. Tongueless Master (Su) : The monk assumes a vow of silence and slices out her own tongue. Thereafter, she wears the preserved appendage on a cord about her neck. She can no longer speak or cast spells with verbal components. Whenever she hits a creature with an unarmed strike, she can spend 1 point from her ki pool to steal the voice from her target. The target can resist this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the scarred monk's level + her Wisdom modifier), otherwise the victim loses the ability to speak or cast spells with verbal components for a number of minutes equal to the total number of mortifications known by the scarred monk. During this time, the scarred monk can speak in the victim's voice. Torturous Vision (Su) : As a move action, the scarred monk can spend 1 ki point to cause a creature that recently wounded her to suffer-in one sudden blast of agony-the pain of all the wounds the scarred monk has endured. The monk can target any living creature within 60 feet who has been affected by share pain in the last 24 hours. The creature becomes stunned with pain for 1 round and then staggered for 1d3 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier). The scarred monk must be at least 13th level and have the share pain mortification in order to take this mortification."

This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-monk. EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES The following archetype can be taken by an ex-monk immediately upon becoming an ex-monk, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-monk replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Sin monks can gain further levels in the monk class, even though becoming an ex-monk normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an atonement spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path.

This works similarly to outside contact except for the following differences: First, he doesn't need to use a magic circle or make a payment (though he still expends 1 point of mental focus from his enchantment implement). Second, he can use those contacts to gather information for him (as per the Diplomacy skill to gather information) without spending the time himself, rather than asking a question and receiving a result similar to a divination. He can ask more questions over the same time period at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, as normal with outside contact. At 16th level, instead of delivering messages and objects, the courtly contacts can spread vicious rumors and gossip about a target throughout a settlement, causing any creatures in the settlement whose attitude toward the target wasn't helpful to have its attitude toward the target worsened by one step. These baseless rumors last 1 week or until the target spends 8 hours refuting them and succeeds at a Diplomacy check (DC = 10 + the ancestral aspirant's occultist level + his Intelligence modifier). This ability replaces outside contact."

The bonded item is masterwork quality and the battle host begins play with it at no cost. The bonded item is immune to the broken condition for as long as the battle host lives. If a battle host dies and is restored to life, the bonded item is also restored if it was destroyed. Any magic powers associated with a battle host's bonded item function only for the battle host; in the hands of anyone else it is only a masterwork item. The bonded item starts as an implement for any single school of magic at 1st level, and gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the battle host access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The battle host's bonded item serves as his implement component to cast occultist spells of all the schools that he knows.

An active component is infused with 1 point of generic mental focus, which the construct collector can expend to activate any focus power at that power's normal cost, as opposed to the increased cost normally associated with generic mental focus. This otherwise functions as expending focus saved inside a construct collector's body. Once this mental focus is expended, the component becomes inactive and is useless. An unused component does not lose its mental focus, even after a construct collector refreshes his mental focus. A construct collector can initially have only one active component at a time.

The construct immediately regains a number of hit points equal to half of the construct collector's current hit points (minimum 1). The construct follows all of the construct collector's orders until the end of the collector's next turn or until reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. Afterwards, the construct is completely destroyed and cannot be repowered again, even by another construct collector.

A lucky few join wealthy organizations replete with relics or inherit undocumented vaults full of historical treasures, and dabble in a wide variety of implements while mastering few. This is especially common in the Aspis Consortium, whose far-flung merchants handle countless relics every year. It's simple enough to snag choice items from Aspis ships, allowing these curators to compile truly prodigious collections. While all agents of the Aspis Consortium are expected to catalog and file their discoveries, in practice many of them keep prizes for their personal use, and the curator has elevated this practice almost to an art form. When confronted by superiors with accusations of failing to hand over rare treasures or mysterious items, the curator is swift to point out that such objects do the group no good sitting on a dusty shelf. Instead, the curator lives up to his name, and seeks to access the ancient powers hidden in such objects so that he can use them in the best interest of the Aspis Consortium. Over time, the Consortium has been forced to admit the wisdom in this way of thinking.",
        "extensive collection (su)": " At 1st level, a curator acquires a collection of esoteric relics that function as occultist implements associated with two schools of magic; he must select these schools and their associated spells when he gains this feature. As a move action, the curator can empower a single piece of his collection, choosing one of the two selected schools, gaining that school's focus power, and accessing the selected spells for 10 minutes. The curator can empower only a single relic at a time in this way, and activating this ability a second time ends any other relic's ongoing benefits. A curator's relic collection has a number of points of mental focus equal to his Intelligence modifier. Empowered relics are automatically invested with these mental focus points; expending a relic's mental focus reduces this total for the day. A curator can use this ability once per day. He can use it an additional time per day at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 6th level and again at 14th level, a curator chooses two additional schools of magic-in addition to their spells- and adds them to his collection. This ability replaces one of the two occultist implements learned at 1st level as well as the implements learned at 6th level and 14th level.",

Whenever he activates his collection, he can use those focus powers associated with his selected school of magic while the relic remains empowered. Whenever the curator would learn another focus power for an implement, he can instead select two new focus powers from different schools associated with his extensive relic collection. This ability replaces the focus power gained at 3rd level.",
        "relic resistance (ex)": " At 4th level, a curator develops a resistance to harmful items. He never gains negative levels due to his alignment as a result of wielding or wearing magic items, and he gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resolve personality conflicts with intelligent magic items. Whenever a cursed item's harmful condition would trigger, a curator can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + the item's CL) to suppress the curse just long enough to discard the item before it activates. Finally, when identifying an item, a curator needs to exceed the item's DC by only 5 (instead of 10) to determine whether the item is cursed. This ability replaces shift focus.",

        "source": "Disciple's Doctrine pg. 8 While most occultists learn to draw power from a variety of implements and objects, esoteric initiates have focused their study entirely on items of antiquity connected to the teachings of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, believing such items to be more powerful than mundane items.",
        "implements of the palatine eye (su)": " An esoteric initiate has formed a supernatural bond with a set of the order's writings collected into a book. If the book is damaged, it is restored to full hit points when the initiate's mental focus refreshes. If the book is lost or destroyed, the initiate can replace it with another similar one, but doing so requires an 8-hour ritual that binds the new book to him. The book serves as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level. The initiate gains new implement schools normally. However, the initiate's additional implements must be masterwork or magic items worth at least 50 gp, and they must directly or nominally represent the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye's beliefs or history. For example, the initiate's implements could be Osirian antiques, trinkets covered in Palatine iconography, or the like. When the initiate benefits from his implements' resonant powers, he treats his occultist level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the powers' benefits only. An esoteric initiate can't save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it. At 4th level, when the initiate gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, he loses no focus when doing so. This alters mental focus, implements, and shift focus.",

When an extemporaneous channeler refreshes her mental focus, she must spend 1 hour preparing her implements for spellcasting but does not immediately invest them with her generic focus, which is equal to her occultist level + twice her Intelligence modifier. At any point during the day, she can shift any amount of her generic focus to any number of her implements by concentrating for 1 round while touching her implements. After every 10 minutes, her invested implements each lose 1 point of mental focus, as if it had been expended on a focus power. If the extemporaneous channeler uses her withdraw focus ability to remove focus before a full 10-minute increment has elapsed, each implement still loses 1 point of mental focus as if it had been invested for that entire increment.

She can give it a maximum bonus of +1 at 1st level; the maximum bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels after 1st, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. The extemporaneous channeler can imbue the item with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to her maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount, such as reducing a +2 bonus to a +1  flaming enchantment. She chooses the special ability when she activates this power, but she can spend 1 point of generic focus as a swift action to change it, which also resets the duration of the power. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (either on its own or from her imbuing it) to gain a weapon special ability. This ability stacks with any other effect that grants an enhancement bonus to an improvised weapon, such as gloves of improvised might , to a maximum of +5.",
        "withdraw focus (su)": " At 4th level, an extemporaneous channeler can, as a standard action, shift any amount of focus from any number of implements back into herself as generic focus. Doing so costs her no loss of focus (other than what's lost due to her fleeting focus ability). Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. This alters shift focus.",

Once per day, an extemporaneous channeler can cast an occultist spell from an implement school she knows as if it were one of her spells known, expending a spell slot of the same level and an amount of generic focus equal to the spell's level to cast the desired spell. A spell cast as an improvised spell always has a minimum casting time of 1 round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 12th level, an extemporaneous channeler can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day.

As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement's spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement's associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector's behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt's spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the magic mouth spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt's square. The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary unseen servant with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as detect undead. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC = 10 + the haunt collector's occultist level) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn't trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement. The haunt collector can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Intelligence modifier. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement's seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement's spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty. If the spell is discharged successfully (rather than the haunt being destroyed), the spirit's presence returns to the haunt collector's implement the following round, and the seance boon and spirit bonus abilities are again available to the haunt collector. At 12th level, the haunt collector can create a free-roaming haunt by expending an additional point of mental focus, granting it a fly speed of 10 feet with good maneuverability, which allows it to change locations or seek targets, under the restrictions for trigger conditions as outlined above. If the haunt wanders beyond medium range (measured from the haunt collector's current position), it is instantly destroyed. At 16th level, the haunt collector can extricate an implement's spirit as a standard action. This ability replaces magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles."

The necroccultist must consume at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biography ( Advanced Player's Guide 206), using the necroccultist's occultist level as his caster level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces object reading.",
        "ghostly horde (su)": "  At 5th level, a necroccultist can spend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to summon a mob of ghostly spirits to harass his enemies. Summoning the ghostly horde is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The ghostly horde appears within 60 feet of the necroccultist, fills an area 20 feet in diameter, and always hovers a few inches off the ground (thus ignoring any difficult terrain). The necroccultist can command the ghostly horde to move up to 30 feet each round as a move action, though the farthest edge of the ghostly horde can never be more than 60 feet from the necroccultist. Any creature caught inside the ghostly horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 occultist levels at the start of its turn (up to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist's occultist level + the necroccultist's Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches as if from supernatural aging. Nonliving creatures and creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. The ghostly horde remains for 1 round, though at the beginning of his turn, the necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus as a swift action to extend the duration for 1 additional round. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces aura sight.",

The ray has a range of 60 feet. The negative levels last a number of minutes equal to the necroccultist's occultist level. For each negative level this attack gives a target, the necroccultist regains a number of hit points equal to his occultist level.

If the ruin has been claimed as a lair for a creature, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the CR of the most powerful creature in the ruin. If the ruin holds a magic item (or multiple magic items), the DC of this check is equal to 11 + the highest caster level of all the magic items in the ruin. If the occult historian succeeds at the check, she learns the layout of the area of the ruin within 30 feet of her (including any secret doors), as well as a piece of information about the structure's history (as determined by the GM). At 5th level, the occult historian can see into a ruin's past. This reveals the same information that can be gathered with the spell retrocognition , except the occult historian can use it only in ruins. If the occult historian succeeds at the check outlined above, she sees the events that occurred in the ruin over the past hour; for each minute she concentrates, she can see 1 additional hour into the ruin's past. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she can see the events that occurred over the past week, plus for 1 additional week per minute she concentrates. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she can see the events of the past year, plus for 1 additional year per minute she concentrates.

If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (the save DC is equal to 10 + half the occult historian's occultist level + her Intelligence modifier), it takes only 5d6 points of damage. A creature slain by this attack crumbles to dust. The occult historian can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day at 16th and 20th levels.

If the magic item doesn't produce a spell effect, the panoply savant can use his caster level against attempts to dispel that item. Additionally, if the item has any abilities that can be used at least three times per day or has three or more daily charges, the panoply savant can spend 1 minute quietly meditating on the item and expend 2 points of mental focus to restore one daily use or one charge to the item. This ability replaces outside contact.",

If the item is unattended, the panoply savant automatically succeeds, but if it is held or worn, he must attempt a special disarm or steal APG combat maneuver check, using his occultist level as his base attack bonus and his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength modifier. If the item in question is an implement he currently has 1 or more points of focus invested in, he gains a bonus on this combat maneuver check equal to twice the amount of focus currently invested in it.

The talisman crafter selects schools as normal (two at 1st level and an additional one at 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter). She creates one master talisman for each implement school she knows, unless she selected that implement school multiple times, in which case she needs one master talisman per time she has selected that school. The talisman crafter splits her mental focus among the schools she knows and generic focus as normal. This ability alters implements.",
        "spellbound tailsman (su)": " At 2nd level, a talisman crafter can inscribe spellbound talismans in addition to her master talismans, infusing small tokens she crafts with psychic spells she knows that normally affect one or more target creatures (but not spells that target the  caster, spells that affect an area, spells that create effects, or other such spells). When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components ( Occult Adventures 144 ) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack  to hit her target. If she hits the target,the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman's spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2. Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans. Once created, a spellbound talisman remains potent until the next time the talisman crafter regains spell slots before losing its magic. Inscribing a spellbound talisman in this manner takes 1 minute of work. This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.",
        "shared talisman (su)": " At 4th level, a talisman crafter can expend 1 point of generic mental focus to create a spellbound talisman that anyone can activate. As long as the spellbound talisman exists, it continues to occupy one of the occultist's spell slots, but can be used by another creature to trigger its effects. Whoever triggers the effect, a shared talisman does not require thought or emotion components, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for casting a spell (though it still does so as normal if thrown). This ability replaces shift focus.",
        "warding seal (su)": " At 5th level, a talisman crafter can inscribe a warding seal, infusing an inscribed glyph with psychic energy. Inscribing the seal follows the rules for drawing magic circles, takes 1 minute, and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements). As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the talisman crafter expends 1 point of mental focus to scribe a special seal, infusing the glyph with a psychic spell she knows that affects one or more creatures and expending the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell. This seal holds the spell energy in check until it's triggered by conditions set forth when the seal is crafted or until the occultist refreshes her mental focus. The seal functions as the spell glyph option of the glyph of warding spell. At 17th level, the talisman crafter's fast circles ability applies to her warding seals, and she treats the ability as the greater spell glyph option of the greater glyph of warding spell. This ability replaces aura sight and the focus powers normally gained at 5th and 17th levels."

They use their bonded tomes to gain access to all sorts of magic, and as they grow in power, they gain an innate sense of the books and writings around them.",
        "bonded tome (su)": "  At 1st level, a tome eater forms a supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace her bonded tome with another book at any time, though the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune herself to the new book. The bonded tome starts as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome eater's bonded tome serves as her implement component to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows. However, she must split her mental focus among the schools she knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though she possesses only one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1 point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to increase the spell's caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner one additional time per day at 6th level, and another time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses beyond 6th. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.",
        "devour books and scrolls (sp)": "  A tome eater can devour books and scrolls in order to gain various benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater's body and completely destroyed. At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical book that contains at least 100 pages of written text and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she regains a number of points of mental focus equal to half the caster level of the item. If the tome eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of mental focus. At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to devour an enemy's spell when an enemy within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were using dispel magic , though the tome eater doesn't need to cast a spell to counter the enemy's spell. A tome eater can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action to use this ability and the readied action never triggers, she doesn't expend a daily use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome eater can use this ability as an immediate action without readying an action. At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can devour the enemy's scroll without spending any additional actions if she hasn't devoured a scroll or book yet that day. At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell back on its caster (as spell turning ) instead of devouring the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured a scroll or book yet that day. This ability replaces shift focus, the implement gained at 6th level, magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.",
        "word sense (sp, su)": "  At 5th level, a tome eater is constantly under the effect of read magic . Additionally, she can automatically detect the general topic of a piece of writing, and whether that writing is a magical scroll or tome, simply by looking at it. If she spends 1 round concentrating on a text within 30 feet per 100 pages of the text, she can gain a sense of a text's contents as if she had skimmed the text. This ability replaces aura sight."

Often, the eerie taint of the black blood can lie dormant in a lineage for generations before manifesting. It even seems capable of reaching out to touch those destined to become oracles through other strange methods. However an oracle becomes black-blooded, her divine powers carry within them the weird power of this chilling magical substance. A black-blooded oracle has the following class features. See the sidebar on the facing page for rules on the black blood itself, but note that a black-blooded oracle does not require access to this eldritch substance to function.",

The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers.

She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead- positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle's coordination somewhat, imparting a -4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle's curse.",
        "black blood revelations": "  All black-blooded oracles have access to the following revelations, regardless of what mystery they choose. Black Blood Spray (Su) : As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target. She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she's attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day). Dark Resilience (Su) : The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle's veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day. Darkvision (Ex) : A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level. Black Blood of Orv Black blood wells from the walls of a singular vault deep in Orv, a region known quite aptly as the Land of Black Blood. This noxious fluid repulses and freezes all natural life, although certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage-10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed. Although black blood isn't itself inherently evil, a pint of black blood can be used as unholy water. A spellcaster who consumes a dose of black blood casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage by drinking the stuff. Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source in the Land of Black Blood, losing all mystical properties. Gentle repose can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood's magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. The blood of a black-blooded oracle is diluted and does not have the properties of full-strength black blood."

A blessing of prosperity lasts up to 1 hour, though the knight of coins who bestowed it can end a blessing's benefits early (whether it affects her or another creature) as a free action. Using this ability requires only one free hand and is a standard action, unless the knight of coins targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. If she knows multiple blessings of prosperity, the knight of coins can bestow multiple blessings on a single target as part of the action and the expenditure of a use of lay on hands required to use this ability. If she bestows multiple different blessings, these blessings are cumulative. For example, a 9th-level knight of coins' blessing of prosperity ability might grant a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks as well as a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks and to CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers. A knight of coins who takes the Extra Mercy feat can gain an extra blessing of prosperity instead of an extra mercy. Once a blessing of prosperity is chosen, it can't be changed. A character who has benefited from a blessing of prosperity cannot benefit from that same blessing again (whether bestowed by the same knight of coins or another knight of coins) for 24 hours. Blessings : The following blessings are available to a knight of coins. The target adds an extra 10% to the gp value gained when selling off treasure (normally 50% of the item's original value). This blessing cannot result in selling treasure for more than 100% of its original value.   The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks.   The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks and to CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers.   The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Craft, Perform, and Profession checks.   The target can use locate object as a spell-like ability once, using the knight of coins' class level as the caster level.   The target can treat one settlement as having its base value and purchase limit increased by 30%. The target must choose the affected settlement when the knight of coins bestows this blessing.   The target can treat one settlement as being one size category larger for the purposes of determining available magic items.

        "divine bond (su)": "  At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: arrow deflection , bashing , blinding , fortification (any), reflecting , and spell resistance (any). The reflecting enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level. If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a -1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.",

Talmandor is reluctant to act directly on behalf of the Eagle Knights and even more unwilling to accept their worship, preferring to lend assistance primarily by being a voice of reason and dispensing wise counsel when it is most needed. A scion of Talmandor attempts to exemplify this selfless altruism, offering assistance to the oppressed and facilitating the peaceful transfer of power from the few to the many. Scions of Talmandor look to the brutality of the revolution in Galt, Andoran's neighbor, as a cautionary tale and an unfortunate blemish on populism's short history. They also reject the Nirmathi notion of freedom, thinking it too individualistic; instead, they strive to build strong communities both at home and abroad.

More rarely a drake is so inspired by a paladin of Apsu that it chooses to assist the paladin in all her actions. These drake allies see the benefit of a silver champion remaining mobile and understand the powerful threats the champion must face, and in time even consent to serve their chosen paladins as a steed.

This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-paladin. EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES The following archetype can be taken by an ex-paladin immediately upon becoming an ex-paladin, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-paladin replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Vindictive bastards can gain further levels in the paladin class, even though becoming an ex-paladin normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an atonement spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path.

An amnesiac's faulty memory makes remembering and casting spells difficult, but the increased flexibility can be a great benefit. Instead of choosing a number of spells known from Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known, an amnesiac accesses spells she knew the previous day from the recesses of her mind. This requires 1 hour of meditation. Each day, for each spell level the amnesiac can cast, she retains a number of spells known equal to half the number listed on Table 1-8, rounded up. These spells must be selected from spells the amnesiac knew the previous day (including any spells she remembered using spell recollection; see below). The remainder of her spells known (half the number on Table 1-8, rounded down) become amnesia slots, which the amnesiac can use with her spell recollection ability (see below). To determine the spells she knows on the day when she first takes this archetype, the amnesiac picks any one 1st-level spell from the psychic spell list. This change to spells doesn't apply to knacks (0-level spells) or discipline spells, which function the same way they do for a normal psychic. When the amnesiac gains access to 3rd-level spells, she gains full recall of her 1st-level spells and no longer gains 1st-level amnesia slots, instead gaining the full number of 1st-level spells known from Table 1-8 and casting them as a normal psychic. When this happens, the amnesiac can select any level-appropriate spells from the psychic spell list as her spells known, even if they were never among the spells she prepared or recalled; once selected, these spells can no longer be changed, as with a normal psychic. Each time the psychic gains access to a new level of spells, she gains full memory of spells 2 levels lower in the same way (gaining full memory and permanently selecting her 2nd-level spells when she gains access to 4thlevel spells, and so on).

Because the mental stress of combat brings memories to the surface more easily, the amnesiac adds 1d10 to this roll's result if she's in combat when she attempts to recall a spell. Regardless of the result, the amnesiac expends an amnesia slot of the appropriate level for the spell she is attempting to remember; she must cast the spell remembered (if any) using that amnesia slot during the same round, or the spell slot is lost without effect. Once a spell has been remembered in this way, the amnesiac can cast it as one of her spells known for the rest of the day (even if she failed to cast the spell during the round in which she remembered it), unless spell recollection allowed her to cast a spell of a higher level than she would normally be able to cast. d% Result   1-10 The amnesiac is unable to cast spells this round.   11-35 The amnesiac can't remember the new spell (but can still cast spells this round).   36-95 The amnesiac remembers and can cast the new spell.   96+ The amnesiac can choose to treat this result as 36-95. Alternatively, once per day, she can instead temporarily recall any spell from the psychic spell list that's 1 level higher than the spell she's attempting to remember.

Enlarged Torso (Ex) : The mutation mind's torso enlarges disproportionately with the rest of her body, granting her a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. Rubbery (Ex) : The mutation mind's body becomes soft and rubbery, granting her DR 2/-. Slimy (Ex) : The mutation mind exudes a thin layer of oily slime over her body, granting her a +4 bonus to CMD. This ability alters phrenic amplifications.",
        "phrenic empowerment (su)": "  At 7th level, a mutation mind's phrenic amplifications empower her physical mutation. Whenever a mutation mind modifies a spell with a phrenic amplification while affected by her physical mutation, she can increase the bonus to her Strength score from her physical mutation by 2 for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell she cast. This bonus doesn't stack; if the mutation mind activates it again, she uses the longer duration but doesn't increase the bonus. While under the effect of phrenic empowerment, whenever the mutation mind takes damage, she risks losing control of her powers. At the end of each turn that she takes hit point damage, the mutation mind must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + 1/2 her character level) or take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws and to Intelligence. These penalties last for 1 hour after the physical mutation ends and stack with themselves. If the penalty lowers her Intelligence score to 0, the mutation mind is comatose until 1 hour after physical mutation ends.",
        "improved bodily mutations": "  At 11th level, a mutation mind can select one of the following improved bodily mutations instead of a phrenic amplification. Aquatic Form (Ex) : The mutation mind's legs fuse into a tail and fins to sprout from her back and side, granting her a swim speed of 30 feet, tremorsense with a range of 30 feet (affecting other creatures in contact with the same body of water), and the aquatic subtype. Her base land speed is reduced to 10 feet. Enlarged Body (Ex) : The mutation mind's body swells and stretches, enlarging her as the enlarge person spell but up to two size categories larger (maximum Huge). Multiple Eyes (Ex) : Multiple eyes erupt all over the mutation mind's body. She can't be flanked and gains a +4 bonus on Perception checks. Recuperation (Ex) : The mutation mind heals quickly from physical wounds, gaining fast healing 5. Toppling Fists (Ex) : The mutation mind's fists become large masses of flesh, allowing her to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against one creature within 10 feet of her as a standard action. Wings (Ex) : The mutation mind sprouts a pair of fleshy, batlike wings, giving her a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. This ability alters major amplifications."

        "psychic duel acumen (ex)": "  At 4th level, a psychic duelist adds instigate psychic duel to her list of spells known, and the save DC of any instigate psychic duel spell she casts increases by 1. Beginning at 6th level, she can also expend any unused psychic spell slot of 3rd level or higher to cast instigate psychic duel . If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. In addition, when the psychic duelist sacrifices points from her phrenic pool to generate manifestation points for an offensive manifestation, she uses d8s for damage dice instead of d4s. This ability replaces the 4th-level discipline spell.",
        "manifestation amplifications": "  At 7th level, a psychic duelist gains a manifestation amplification instead of a phrenic amplification; thereafter, whenever the psychic duelist gains a phrenic amplification, she can select either a phrenic amplification or a manifestation amplification. A manifestation amplification functions for a manifestation as a phrenic amplification does for a spell, with the same restrictions. The manifestation being amplified is called the linked manifestation. Phrenic pool points spent toward manifestation amplifications are separate from points sacrificed to generate manifestation points. For example, a psychic duelist capable of casting 4th-level spells (with a maximum of 4 MP per manifestation) could turn 4 points from her phrenic pool into MP and spend 2 points on a manifestation amplification, expending a total of 6 points from her phrenic pool. Extended Effect (Ex) : The psychic duelist can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the duration of a condition by 1 round per point spent. She can spend a maximum of 1 phrenic pool point in this way; this maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level, to 3 points at 15th level, and to 4 points at 19th level. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, this amplification has no effect (though the points are still lost). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations that impose conditions. Faithful Creature (Ex) : When she manifests a thoughtform creature, the psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give that creature the ability to persist even if it doesn't attack. She can concentrate to maintain the creature as a swift action instead of as a full-round action, but the creature can attack only if the psychic duelist concentrates as a full-round action. In addition, the psychic backlash damage from that thought-form creature is halved. This amplification can be linked only to thoughtform creature manifestations. Punishing Thought-form (Ex) : The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase the damage die size of an offensive manifestation by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, or d8 to d10). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations. Reciprocal Defense (Su) : The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when using a defensive manifestation to improve her defenses in the real world as well. Her physical body gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for the number of rounds the defensive manifestation lasts, or for 1 round if the manifestation doesn't have a duration. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to +4 at 15th level. This amplification can be linked only to defensive manifestations. This ability replaces the 7th-level phrenic amplification and alters phrenic amplifications.",
        "thought made real (su)": "  At 9th level, a psychic duelist can bring offensive manifestations directly into her foes' minds, attacking with them without entering a psychic duel. When doing so, she can generate manifestation points only by sacrificing a spell, not through any other methods. Using an offensive manifestation in this way functions as casting a spell with a full-round-action casting time. Conditions imposed by these offensive manifestations last for their full duration, even though the target isn't in a psychic duel. The psychic duelist can use manifestation amplifications on offensive manifestations created this way. Such offensive manifestations can't affect thought-form creatures. This is a mind-affecting illusion (phantasm) effect. A thoughtform creature manifested in this way is visible only to its target. This ability replaces telepathic bond",
        "expert manifester (ex)": "  At 17th level, a psychic duelist doesn't have to expend as many resources to create manifestations. She gains 1 additional MP each time she creates a psychic manifestation, in addition to the MP she gains by sacrificing resources. This doesn't increase the maximum number of points she can spend per manifestation, but does allow her to create a manifestation costing 1 MP without sacrificing any resources. This ability replaces telepathy."

But she does not crumble under the strain of this insanity; instead, she cordons it off to use as a shield against other psychic intrusions and harnesses it to unleash it upon the world around her.

As a standard action, the psychic marauder can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to manifest an aura of insanity, letting bits of her psyche penetrate the minds of those around her. The aura is centered on the psychic marauder and has a radius of 10 feet, increasing by 5 feet for every 3 class levels beyond 3rd. Any creature starting its turn within the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the psychic marauder's level + the psychic marauder's Charisma modifier) or be confused for 1 round. The psychic marauder can exclude a number of targets inside the radius equal to 1 + 1 for every 3 class levels beyond 3rd, shielding them from her madness. The aura of insanity lasts for a number of rounds equal to the psychic marauder's Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 11th level, when a creature rolls to determine the effects of a confusion effect while within the aura of insanity, the psychic marauder can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to force the affected creature to roll twice. The psychic marauder selects which result is used. At 19th level, when a creature would roll to determine the effects of a confusion effect while within the aura of insanity, the psychic marauder can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to select the result of the affected creature's confused condition without rolling. This does not allow the psychic marauder to control how that result is applied. This ability replaces the phrenic amplifications gained at 3rd, 11th, and 19th levels.",

Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the terror weaver can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. At 11th level, a terror weaver's aura of doom causes enemies to become frightened instead of shaken. At 19th level, it causes enemies to become panicked.

Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possible animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion).

A corpse hunter does not gain additional favored enemies at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, though his favored enemy bonus against undead creatures increases by 2 at each of these levels (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level).",

As a standard action, the corpse hunter can make a single melee attack against an undead creature, or a single ranged attack against an undead creature within 30 feet. If the attack is successful, he deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the target undead creature in addition to normal damage. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another creature within 120 feet, the controller takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage as well; unlike the initial target, the controller may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the corpse hunter's class level + the corpse hunter's Wisdom modifier) to halve the damage she would take from this attack.

Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A dandy can attempt the appropriate Knowledge checks untrained to identify such people from the selected country.

This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal. A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor's tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally. The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village-to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis. If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person. This ability replaces wild empathy.",

        "dandy spells (su)": " At 4th level, the dandy gains a different sort of spellcasting than most rangers. A dandy uses his Charisma instead of his Wisdom to determine spells per day, DCs, and other factors related to spellcasting. He casts spells spontaneously from the bard spell list (rather than the ranger spell list) with the same number of spells known and spells per day as a medium ( Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 30 ) of his ranger level. This ability alters the ranger's spellcasting.",
        "party crasher (ex)": " At 7th level, the dandy is able to finagle his way into fancy parties, kings' balls, and other social events meant for the cream of society. To do so, he must attempt a DC 25 Diplomacy check, which takes 1d4 hours. If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party. This does not allow him to break into restricted areas or to infiltrate strictly closed gatherings, such as secret meetings; it only allows him access to social events.

He selects two warpriest domains from among the domains granted by his deity, and gains the minor blessings of those domains. A divine tracker can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a divine tracker isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval.

Many of Nirmathas's rangers take the guide or skirmisher archetypes (see the Advanced Player's Guide ), but some focus on the magic of stealth.

Aligned Plane : If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Astral Plane : Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move action.

Ethereal Plane : The planar scout can damage incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal creatures. First World : As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level. Plane of Air : As a swift action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not be used consecutively. Plane of Earth : The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level. Plane of Fire : As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage.

Some classes, like the ranger, interact directly with terrain, and class abilities like favored terrain can become complicated in a plane-hopping campaign. In games that are largely limited to the Material Plane, the planes terrain category works fine, but if you intend to run a game set on another plane, you should consider breaking up that category into specific planes (thus, a ranger would choose Heaven or Ethereal Plane, or even a demiplane like Leng as a favored terrain), or simply doing away with the planes category entirely. With this latter solution, you should work with ranger players to help them anticipate the terrains featured in your upcoming campaign, with new categories like crystalline (for realms in the Plane of Earth or under Elysium, where immense crystal formations are common), living (for truly sentient realms like portions of the Abyss), or void (for empty reaches in the Astral Plane or the energy planes) potentially becoming new options for rangers to select from."

The raven master must select a bird as her animal companion. The raven companion starts with an Intelligence score of 3 and can speak one language known by the raven master. In addition to the normal abilities an animal companion gains as the raven master increases in level, the raven companion gains the following abilities. This ability alters hunter's bond and replaces specific ranger abilities as indicated below. Silver Champion (Ex) : At 7th level, the raven companion takes on a silvery, metallic appearance. It treats all of its natural attacks as though they were magic and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. This ability replaces woodland stride. Mimic Figurine (Su) : At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, the raven master can transform her raven companion into a token similar to a figurine of wondrous power . Any gear worn by the raven melds into its body as part of this transformation, but held items do not. The raven can remain in this form indefinitely, or until the raven master spends a standard action to activate the statuette as though it were a figurine of wondrous power This ability replaces swift tracker. Cheat Death (Sp) At 12th level, once per week, when a raven companion would otherwise be slain by an attack, spell, or effect, it can turn into a figurine of wondrous power as per its mimic figurine ability as an immediate action.

If the realm wanderer releases his animal companion from service or it perishes, he can gain a new fiendish animal companion by completing the required ceremony. Alternatively, when the realm wanderer releases his animal companion or it dies in his service, he can use his influence over its fiendish nature to cause the animal to lose the fiendish template. If the animal companion is then raised or otherwise brought back from the dead after the realm wanderer removes its fiendish template, the animal companion no longer takes the penalty on attacks described above.

At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can't even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can't be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank ). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence , and negate aroma APG all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder's location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities. This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day. Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability.

At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick. A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can't be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger's spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items. The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects. Aiding Attack (Ex) : The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he hits a creature with an attack. The next ally who makes an attack against the target creature before the start of the ranger's next turn gains a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll. Bolster Companion (Ex) : The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal companion is hit with an attack or a combat maneuver. The companion's AC and combat maneuver defense increase by +4 for the purposes of that attack. If the attack still hits, the animal companion only takes half damage (if any). The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to benefit from this trick. Catfall (Ex) : The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when he falls 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall when calculating the falling damage. If the ranger takes no damage from the fall, he does not fall prone. Chameleon Step (Ex) : The ranger can move up to twice his speed as a move action. The ranger does not take any penalty on Stealth checks for movement during this move. This move provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. Cunning Pantomime (Ex) : As a standard action, the ranger can communicate with a single creature as if using the tongues spell for 10 minutes.

Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours.

      "Bellflower Irrigator": {
        "source": "Adventurer's Guide pg. 43 Bellflower irrigators take on tasks that many other agents of the Bellflower Network find distasteful. Rather than focusing on saving slaves, Bellflower irrigators seek to defeat slavery by aiming to eliminate the source. They gauge the precise moment to strike from the shadows and annihilate slave traders and masters alike. Bellflower irrigators realize that for every slave released today, another will be shackled tomorrow-until all the masters are dead. This cynicism leads Bellflower irrigators to target anyone who owns or sells slaves on Golarion, especially cruel masters within Cheliax. Though most Bellflower irrigators are halflings, this branch of the Network is more diverse than many of the others-anyone with a hatred of slavery and a talent for stealth and martial combat is free to join. Bellflower irrigators employ combat methods that many find questionable, such as the use of poison and calculated strikes meant to kill rather than incapacitate. The Bellflower Network does not knowingly allow evil members, but very few Bellflower irrigators are good-most are chaotic neutral in alignment, as their methods of solving the problem of slavery often force them into moral and ethical gray areas. A few Bellflower irrigators are in fact evil, but these rarities do their best to hide their personal lack of morals and addiction to cruelty in order to maintain their positions and connection to the Bellflowers, for as evil as they may be, they share a hatred of slavery with their more altruistic kin. An evil Bellflower irrigator who is found out is typically exiled from the group, yet most continue to fight slavery even after they are sent away in this way.",

        "irrigation (ex)": " At 8th level, if a Bellflower irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Bellflower irrigator's choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the Bellflower irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Bellflower irrigator's class level + the Bellflower irrigator's Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the Bellflower irrigator has. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Bellflower irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Bellflower irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th.

Whether a dreamshard is shaped from the dreamer's aggregated emotions or manifested from a repressed aspect of herself, this metaphysical crystal grants a dreamthief supernatural powers, which she supplements with skill and grace.

Her Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll she sacrificed would have taken, and if she trades an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, she also takes a penalty based on that attack's lower base attack bonus (a -5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a -10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a -15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if she manages to gain one). If she succeeds at the Bluff check, the movement doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance (see page 45) until its next turn.

A toxic talon can use rare, complex, slow-release poisons to make a death look like it happened naturally, but sometimes the toxic talon will use specific poisons to cast suspicion on other organizations, stirring internal conflict that other Twilight Talons can use to their advantage. The use of poisons in the defense of a good nation is controversial, and other branches of the Eagle Knights generally disavow the existence of toxic talons among their organization. Many influential leaders among the Eagle Knights, particularly in the Steel Falcons, have pushed to have the practices of the toxic talons banned from use, but these efforts have only pushed the toxic talons into further obscurity. Their role is particularly protected by the Twilight Talons, who sometimes go as far as to outright lie to others in the Eagle Knights about the operations of a toxic talon. At other times, a toxic talon may choose to martyr his freedom by publicly accepting blame for a mission that has had unfortunate public repercussions. In such a case, the toxic talon is not abandoned by his kin-instead, he is placed on a fair and public trial whose purpose is as much to appease the masses as it is to determine whether any moral lines were crossed. In cases where such a toxic talon is found guilty, he is generally sentenced to hard labor or prison (in which case he often continues to run missions inside of prisons or other fortifications for the Eagle Knights as best suits his talents) or to exile (in which case his role in serving Andoran shifts to one of clandestine missions in other nations). A toxic talon who martyrs his freedom in this way and is then captured again understands that it's unlikely he'll be afforded the same level of support from the Eagle Knights, and that the organization may well disavow any official knowledge of his actions. To a toxic talon, this is all merely a deeper, more significant level of service to the well-being of the nation of Andoran. By serving as a sort of sineater for the rest of the Twilight Talons (and at times, for the other branches of the Eagle Knights), such selfless characters can ensure that the organization survives scandal and public outcry to carry on their good work. In such cases, while public recognition for their deeds may never manifest, their brothers and sisters never forget the toxic talon's sacrifice.",

This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's spirit.",
        "wrangle condition (su)": " At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart. The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured. Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened. Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered. Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated. Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned. The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself. At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.",

This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist's exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.",

The animist's soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar's senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist's soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.",

A benefactor cannot gain a hex that is a curse effect or that has the word 'curse' in its name as a hex or a wandering hex. This ability alters hexes. Boon Reservoir (Su) : Once per day, a benefactor can perform a 10-minute ritual with one of her allies, plus one additional ally for every 3 shaman levels she has. All creatures that participate in the ritual (including the benefactor) gain a boon reservoir with a number of points equal to 1/2 the benefactor's shaman level (minimum 1) for 24 hours. As an immediate action, a creature can spend 1 point from its boon reservoir to gain a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws it attempts until the start of its next turn. Boon reservoir points that are not spent within 24 hours are wasted. Expanded Boon (Su) : When a benefactor gains this hex, she chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or skill checks. Instead of gaining an insight bonus on saving throws, any creature with a boon reservoir granted by the benefactor can spend 1 point as an immediate action to gain a +2 insight bonus on rolls or checks of the chosen kind until the start of its next turn. This hex can be chosen multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different roll or check. A benefactor must have the boon reservoir hex before choosing this hex. Suppress Curse (Sp) : As a standard action, a benefactor can attempt to suppress one curse effect that is affecting a creature or object with a touch. This functions as per remove curse , except the curse's effects are suppressed for 1 hour, even if it is a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor. This allows a creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove or get rid of it. The benefactor uses her shaman level as her caster level for the purpose of this hex."

Many crystal tenders take it upon themselves to guard rich gem veins and other mineral treasures from those who would mine them out of greed, much in the way that surface-dwelling druids might defend a sacred grove from woodcutters. The crystal tenders of Orv meditate within the Crystal Womb, often near the churning vortex that makes up the heart of the Vault. They learn to focus the cavern's energies through ley lines in the stone, and they study the birth of crystals within the Womb in order to mimic the process.",

Her spirit animal always appears to be composed of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750 gp per shaman level. This alters spirit animal.",

When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine as long as they're within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this ability, the crystal tender's skin takes on a crystalline sheen. The DR gained from this ability increases to 2/ adamantine at 8th level, 3/adamantine at 12th level, 4/adamantine at 16th level, and 5/adamantine at 20th level. This alters wandering spirit.",

The crystal tender's spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender's Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don't gain any additional abilities, save that they don't orbit the spirit animal and can't be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body. This replaces the shaman hex gained at 8th level.",

The deep shaman must choose a spirit animal with the aquatic subtype, and it gains the amphibious special quality instead of gaining the ability to breathe in water. A deep shaman gains Swim as a class skill. This alters spirit, spirit animal, and the shaman's class skills.",

Her crashing waves hex applies to her spirit abilities that deal damage as if they were spells with the water descriptor, raising her effective shaman level for those abilities. Instead of mist's shroud and watersight, she can select the two hexes below. This alters hexes. Buoyancy Control (Sp) : The deep shaman touches a willing creature and changes its buoyancy (see page 43) to whichever of the five states she wishes for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex can't be affected by it again for 24 hours. The deep shaman has neutral buoyancy, regardless of what her normal buoyancy would be, though she can end or resume the effect as a standard action. Deep Heart (Su) : The deep shaman gains the ability to breathe underwater and gains a swim speed equal to her unmodified base land speed. At 8th level, she takes only half the normal amount of pressure damage and she adjusts to a new pressure all at once after succeeding at five Fortitude saves, rather than 100 feet at a time (see Pressure on page 48).",
        "aquatic spirit abilities (su)": " When used underwater, a deep shaman's wave strike deals lethal bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away 5 feet + an additional 5 feet for every 6 shaman levels she has. At 11th level, whenever the deep shaman is underwater, all weapons she holds are treated as if they had the impact special ability instead of quenching . Instead of a swim speed and the ability to breathe underwater, fluid mastery provides tremorsense with a range of 30 feet while in the water, and when underwater, fluid mastery's torrent deals 1d6 points of damage per shaman level in a 30-foot cone. This alters spirit ability and greater spirit ability.",

She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell's breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater doesn't count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses.

She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can't select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn't gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit.

Channel Luck (Su) : A serendipity shaman gains the ability to channel luck, as the cleric variant channeling ability of the same name ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 30 ), using her shaman level to determine her effective cleric level for the purpose of her channel energy ability. She does not count as having the channel energy ability for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites or prestige class requirements with the exception of Selective Channeling, which the shaman can take as normal. A shaman must be at least 8th level before selecting this hex. Fortune (Ex) : This hex functions as the dual-cursed oracle revelation of the same name (Ultimate Magic 58), using the shaman's class level as her effective oracle level. Misfortune (Ex) : As a standard action, a serendipity shaman can afflict one target within 30 feet with misfortune, causing it to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws against the shaman's spells. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target hits the shaman with an attack. Spirit Magic : A serendipity shaman adds both her spirit's spirit magic spells and the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability. This hex cannot be taken as a wandering hex. Tweak the Odds (Su) : Whenever the serendipity shaman or one of her allies within 30 feet rolls an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, the shaman can use this ability as an immediate action to tweak the odds in her favor, increasing the result of the die roll or check by 1. This can turn a normal hit into a critical threat, but it cannot make an attack roll an automatic hit (this bonus does not stack with effects that increase a weapon's critical threat range, such as Improved Critical or keen edge). The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level. At 4th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can spend an additional use of this ability to further increase the die result of the target's roll by an additional 1.

The effects of the abilities depend on the elemental combination, as detailed below. Ash Storm (Su) : By combining air and fire, the elementalist shifter surrounds herself with a storm of swirling ash, granting her a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks. Downpour (Su) : The elementalist shifter combines the powers of air and water to generate a torrential downpour in her square and squares adjacent to her.

Mudslide (Su) : Combining the elements of earth and water causes the elementalist shifter to generate an aura of mud.

Sandstorm (Su) : Combining the high winds of air and fine particulates of earth produces a sandstorm that extends out to a radius of 20 feet from the elementalist shifter. All light levels in the area diminish by one step, and creatures caught in the effect take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they remain within the sandstorm. Steam Cloud (Su) When the elementalist shifter enters a minor form of fire and water at the same time, the heat of fire and moisture of water generate an explosive area of steam around her out to a radius of 20 feet as per obscuring mist . The mist remains in place until she ends her elemental aspect; it doesn't move with her. Volcanic Stride (Su) : By combining earth and fire, the elementalist shifter can damage the ground around herself. As a standard action, she can deform a region of natural or artificial rock in her space, turning it into difficult terrain and causing creatures that pass through it to take an amount of fire damage equal to that dealt by her elemental strike with no save. Affected terrain remains transformed until the shifter ends her elemental aspect. This replaces chimeric aspect and greater chimeric aspect. Elemental Aspects (Elementalist Shifter Aspects) Elementalist shifters do not infuse their bodies with bestial qualities taken from animal aspects. Rather, they take into themselves raw elemental power from the planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The following aspects are used by the elementalist shifter archetype; they cannot be selected as aspects by other shifters. Air You take on the power of an air elemental, gaining the ability to fly and to control powerful gusts of wind. You take inspiration from the patterns of clouds in the sky, the tumultuous fury of the storm, and the gentle caress of a cooling breeze. Flying creatures, such as bats and birds, are your favorites. Spring is your favored season-a time when storms bring freshness to the world but that lacks the brutality of winter's devastation.",

While you are in this form, your base speed is reduced to 20 feet but you gain a swim speed of 60 feet, and if both you and your target are touching water, you also gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. If the target is touching the ground, you take a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against it. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers, whether you are initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. At 8th level, your swim speed increases to 90 feet, your touch automatically extinguishes nonmagical flames of size Large or smaller, and you can dispel magical fires as per dispel magic using your shifter level as your effective caster level. At 15th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam and the vortex special ability, which functions identically to the air aspect's whirlwind ability (see page 79) but can form only underwater and cannot leave the water."

The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter's claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter's claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method.

While some shifters consider the oozemorph to be unsettling or even vile, these shifters merely embrace a stranger form of life than most.

An oozemorph treats her creature type as both ooze and her base creature type from her race for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger's favored enemy). In this form, the oozemorph is immune to critical hits and precision damage and can't be flanked. However, she has no magic item slots and she cannot benefit from armor; cast spells; hold objects; speak; or use any magic item that requires activation, is held, or is worn on the body. An oozemorph reverts to this formless state whenever she is unconscious or in an area of antimagic. This is treated as a polymorph effect. A number of times per day equal to half her level (minimum 1), an oozemorph can assume a humanoid form as a move action. This transformation is identical to alter self , except the oozemorph can maintain the form for a number of hours equal to her level. Each hour after this duration, the oozemorph must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or revert back to her fluidic body until she rests for at least 8 hours. This save DC increases by 1 for each additional hour spent maintaining the form. At 8th level, the oozemorph can treat this ability as beast shape I , and at 15th level, she can treat this ability as beast shape II or giant shape I Ending this transformation at any time reverts the oozemorph back to her ooze form and renders her fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of hours she maintained the form. This replaces chimeric form, greater chimeric form, wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements of shifter aspect.",

An oozemorph can change the damage type of any number of her natural weapons as a swift action. An oozemorph gains one additional primary natural attack at 6th level and another at 15th level. The total number of natural attacks an oozemorph has at any given time includes those gained via her current form. For example, an 8th-level oozemorph who has taken the form of a wolf with beast shape I has a bite attack as part of that form; she can create only two additional natural attacks via morphic weaponry, for a total of three attacks available to her at that level.

        "oozemorph shifter: how does the oozemorph's fluidic body work? can the oozemorph actually move at all in ooze form? why does a supernatural ability still have an effect in an antimagic field?": "Fluidic Body is essentially two effects in one. The first, which is a permanent part of your character once you become an oozemorph, is that your base form is now an ooze shape. Even if you lose fluidic body for some reason (antimagic field, violating your code of conduct, etc) your base form is still the amorphous oozelike form. The other half of the ability is a supernatural polymorph effect to transform into humanoid (and later bestial) forms. Despite having an oozelike shape, an oozemorph's base form is not an ooze, though it does also count as an ooze for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type. The oozelike form doesn't gain any abilities of the ooze creature type except as stated by the archetype itself. This form retains the base senses and land speed of the oozemorph's original race, as well as racial abilities like dwarfs' greed or gnomes' obsession that don't depend on shape, but it loses abilities dependent on form, including form-based speeds like strix's flight (and most other racial speeds beyond land speed), racial natural attacks like catfolks' claws, and other abilities like tieflings' prehensile tail. However, if the oozemorph possesses a racial ability denied her in her oozelike form and transforms into a member of her own race with fluidic body, she gains the full benefits of that racial ability for that duration, even if it isn't usually granted when using alter self (or the appropriate spell for a non-humanoid oozemorph). An oozemorph's compression, damage reduction, and morphic weaponry function in its oozelike form and any form it takes via fluidic body, though not in forms it takes via other polymorph effects. These clarifications will be reflected in the next errata.",
        "oozemorph and items: i know i don't have any item slots as an ooze, but what about items that take 24 hours to attune? can i just never use those items?": "An oozemorph can carry items floating in its mass that are considered to be attuned. When it turns into a humanoid form via fluidic body, it can equip any number of those items (even armor, which usually takes time to don), leaving the rest on the ground in its space. If it turns into a animal via fluidic form, the items meld into the new form and grant some passive benefits, as normal for polymorph effects"

At the start of the rageshaper's next turn, he not only gains the benefit of rage but also grows one size category larger (though worn equipment and held items do not increase in size). Armor or clothing the rageshaper wears that doesn't accommodate his changing size immediately gains the broken condition. If insufficient room is available to accommodate this change, the rageshaper attains the maximum possible size for the available space and can attempt a Strength check (using his increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If the check fails, he is constrained but not harmed by the materials enclosing him. A rageshaper can remain in his devastating form for a number of rounds per day equal to his shifter level. He can dismiss devastating form only with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + his shifter level) made as a free action. On a failed save, the attempted remains in devastating form for an additional round. If the rageshaper does not successfully end his devastating form before he runs out of daily rounds, the next time he fails his Will save to revert, he flies into an uncontrollable frenzy as if affected by confusion, but he treats a roll of 26-50 as 'attacks nearest creature.' Each round the rageshaper spends in an uncontrollable frenzy, the Will save DC to exit devastating form decreases by 2. When a rageshaper ends his devastating form ability, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds he spent in devastating form. A rageshaper cannot enter devastating form again while fatigued or exhausted. If a rageshaper falls unconscious, his devastating form ends immediately. At 10th level, the rageshaper can grow up to a maximum of two size categories larger with devastating form and his rage is now treated as greater rage.

Form of the Panther : You gain a bonus to damage rolls for retaliatory unarmed strikes made with Panther Style equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum +0). At 8th level, this bonus increases to twice your Wisdom modifier. At 15th level, if a creature misses an attack of opportunity against you prompted by your movement through a threatened square, you can make a retaliatory unarmed strike against that creature, even if you would not normally be able to make any more retaliatory strikes this turn. Form of the Snake : Once per round when you hit a single foe with two or more unarmed strikes and deal piercing damage on your turn, you knock that foe off-balance.

She must still attack a target as normal, even if occupying the same space as her target. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a swarm shifter becomes immune to bull rush, grapple, and trip combat maneuvers while in vermin form.

While in a hybrid form, she gain a +2 size bonus to her Strength score, a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC, and all of the natural attacks and abilities listed by her major form. A weretouched also counts as being in her natural form for the purpose of determining whether she can extend her shifter claws. A weretouched's hybrid form is roughly the same size and shape as her natural form, albeit with bestial qualities such as digitigrade legs or shaggy fur, so her equipment does not merge into her new form when she shifts between her natural form and hybrid form. In addition, the size of a weretouched's hybrid form is the same as the size of her natural form. This otherwise counts as assuming a major form using wild shape. This alters wild shape."

For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends.

This raging song functions just like a Diplomacy check to make a simple request or an Intimidate check but can influence only animals. The bacchanal rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the urging check's result. Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these nonanimals, the bacchanal takes a -4 penalty on this check. The bacchanal must continue to perform the song for the entire time required for the check; otherwise, its effect is wasted, but only 1 round of raging song is expended regardless of how long the check takes. This raging song replaces song of marching. Maddening Dance (Su) : At 10th level, the bacchanal's raging song can compel a creature within 30 feet to perform an ecstatic dance. Unless it succeeds at its Will save, the victim becomes confused, takes a -2 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saving throws, and loses the benefit of any shield it holds. The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature.

This works like geas/quest , except it applies only if the target is truly willing (not magically compelled or tricked), and the target automatically understands the full terms of the agreement before deciding whether he is willing. The battle scion can offer a reward for the completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either).

The ally can attempt to resist this urge with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald's class level + his Charisma modifier). If she fails the save or chooses not to attempt one, the Strength and Constitution bonuses of the demon dancer's inspire rage increase by 2, and she must continue to attack the same target each round.

Song of Understanding (Su) : At 6th level, a twilight speaker can use his raging song to create an aura that allows creatures to speak and understand each others' languages.

This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 16th level. The urban skald can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2.

This alters inspired rage. Infuriating Mockery (Su) : At 3rd level, the urban skald can inspire reckless fury in one foe within 30 feet.

Humiliating Defamation (Su) : At 10th level, the urban skald can ostracize a foe. The song has one primary target, who the skald must see and name or describe. That target must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells, even if it casts them on itself ). These effects remain as long as the primary target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance. All other foes within 60 feet of the skald are secondary targets.

The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)-but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action. A war painter can apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time.

Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power ( Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80 ) or a totem rage power ( Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 74 ). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.

Once while benefiting from the paint's raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint's other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.

This shadow double remains in his square, mimicking his movements as a single mirror image , except that it lasts until it is destroyed or he chooses to dismiss it as a swift action. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability of the Trickery domain. At 5th level, an ankou's shadow gains a second shadow double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror image s in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do not protect the ankou's shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou's shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou's shadow can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou's shadow's gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double's gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou's shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou's shadow's touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou's shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou's shadow does. Mind-affecting effects targeting a shadow double affect the ankou's shadow instead, though he isn't affected twice by effects that target both him and a shadow double. At 10th level, an ankou's shadow gains a third shadow double. He can divide his actions between his actual body and his shadow doubles, using them as the origin point for attacks or abilities. For example, an ankou's shadow making three attacks as a part of a full attack could make his primary attack from his own body and his other two attacks from two of his shadow doubles. At 15th level, an ankou's shadow gains a fourth shadow double.

He can make any number of attacks in any combination of squares along this single jump, up to his maximum number of attacks, but he can attack a given creature once at most. If the avalancher attempts a jump but fails the Acrobatics check, he makes no attacks and suffers the consequences of his failed jump normally.

Distant Voices (Sp) : At 1st level, a bloody jake can cause his voice to seem to emanate from somewhere else, as per ventriloquism.

The first creature to enter the square triggers the rune of warding, and becomes the target of the selected spell. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune. The rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to the stone warder's level or until discharged. If placed on a solid rock or stone surface, it instead lasts 1 minute per sorcerer level the stone warder has or until discharged. The stone warder cannot create a rune of warding in a square occupied by an existing rune of warding or another creature. The rune counts as a spell of the same level as the spell stored within it for the purposes of dispelling. It is considered a magic trap and can be discovered with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell) and disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell).

If she manifests two lashes, she can wield them both as light melee weapons, each dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/ x2. If the ectoplasmatist manifests only one lash, she can manifest it either as a single one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of slashing damage (1d6 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/ x2, or as a two-handed melee weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d10 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical multiplier of  x2. Only the ectoplasmatist can wield or use these lashes. Dismissing any or all manifested lashes is a free action. At 2nd level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and are treated as magic weapons. At 4th level, the ectoplasmatist can use her lashes as reach weapons or use them to manipulate objects from a distance. When used as weapons, the lashes gain an additional 5 feet of reach. Unlike most other weapons with reach, the lashes can be used to attack foes anywhere within the ectoplasmatist's reach (including adjacent foes). Attacks with the lashes' extended reach provoke attacks of opportunity just as if the ectoplasmatist were attacking with a ranged weapon. When the lashes are used to manipulate items, they have the same manual dexterity as the ectoplasmatist's hands. Using the lashes to manipulate items always provokes attacks of opportunity, even if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking normally wouldn't. At 6th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +2, and they are treated as having the ectoplasmatist's alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes become ghost touch weapons and their reach increases by another 5 feet (for a total increase of 10 feet). Additionally, attacks with the lashes against nonadjacent foes no longer provoke attacks of opportunity. Using the lashes to manipulate objects from a distance still provokes attacks of opportunity, but only if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking would normally provoke such attacks (instead of always provoking). At 10th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +3. At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a single emotional focus (anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, or zeal).

The ectoplasmatist takes a -2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus.

The spell must have a range of touch  or personal, and it must be a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. For every 3 spiritualist levels he has beyond 12th, the maximum spell level of this spell increases by 1.

When a spiritualist gains this ability, she must replace her ability to form either an ectoplasmic bonded manifestation or an incorporeal bonded manifestation. When the fated guide uses this thanatopic bond, she gains access to the benefits of her phantom's Deific Obedience feat, and can use speak with dead as per the spell, asking a maximum of one question per spiritualist level she has each day, and no more than one question per corpse; asking a question and getting an answer requires 2 full rounds. At 8th level, the fated guide can act normally even after being reduced below 0 hit points. The spiritualist immediately dies if reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to her Constitution score. She takes 1 extra point of damage each round she performs a strenuous action, such as attacking or casting a spell, and immediately falls unconscious and begins dying if she dismisses the thanatopic bond or the duration of bonded manifestation expires.

A fractured mind can use each of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the level at which she gained the spell-like ability.

As a result, the phantom has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The slam attack's damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level, to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level. While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler's phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures. Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures. This ability alters the phantom.",

The phantom gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler's consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities. Unnerving Touch (Su) : As a standard action, a geist channeler's phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don't cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Poltergeist's Knack (Sp) : At 7th level, a geist channeler's phantom can use telekinesis as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom's Hit Dice. Spectral Protection (Su) : At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler's phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler's spiritualist class level + the geist channeler's Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don't need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Malevolent Possession (Sp) : At 17th level, a geist channeler's phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as possession (see page 181). To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day. This ability modifies the phantom and replaces the phantom's emotional focus.",

Hag-haunted spiritualists are tethered to these spiteful spirits, anchoring them once again in the world of the living. While this partnership imparts powerful magic, they run the constant risk of serving as little more than mounts for their overwhelming phantoms. Hag-haunted spiritualists are rarely the masters in their relationship with their phantoms, and the only tool at their disposal to control their wicked minion is to dismiss them back to the Ethereal Plane. In the best scenarios, the relationship is one of mutual competition and constant bargaining, but just as often the hag phantom dominates and abuses her spiritualist.",

When in the spiritualist's consciousness, the hag phantom can grant the hag-haunted Spell Focus (necromancy) and Skill Focus (Bluff), but she often revokes them if the spiritualist banishes her there as a punishment, and she might use them as leverage to get what she wants.

When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted's body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist's turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted's spiritualist level. The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted's features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an enlarge person spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect's duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn't gain the benefits of usurp manifestation.

This ability consumes two of the haunted's spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities. Teleplasmic Surge : At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

Phantom Weapon Ability Descriptions A phantom weapon has special abilities (or imparts abilities to its wielder) depending on the wielder's spiritualist level. These abilities are cumulative. A phantom weapon normally refuses to use any of its abilities when wielded by anyone other than its phantom blade, and acts as an incorporeal masterwork weapon of its type. Alertness (Ex) : While the phantom blade is wielding or harboring her phantom weapon , she gains the Alertness feat. Phantom Touch (Ex) : A phantom weapon is always treated as a ghost touch weapon, regardless of weapon type or any other abilities modifying the weapon. If the phantom weapon would ever be destroyed, it is instead harbored in the spiritualist's consciousness for 24 hours. Telepathy (Su) : While the phantom blade is wielding or carrying her phantom weapon , she can communicate telepathically with the weapon. Weapon of the Mind (Ex) : The phantom blade can harbor her phantom weapon in her consciousness or manifest it in its ectoplasmic form. The phantom blade can manifest the weapon through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. Harboring the phantom weapon requires a full-round action. While the weapon is harbored, the phantom blade gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat and treats her unarmed strike damage as a monk of her level - 2. If the phantom blade already has this feat, she instead gains Weapon Focus (unarmed strike). The phantom blade's unarmed strikes gain the phantom weapon 's enhancement bonus and other abilities when the weapon is harbored. The phantom weapon also recovers a number of hit points equal to its ego score every hour that it is harbored. Quick Manifest (Ex) : At 3rd level, the phantom blade can manifest her phantom weapon as a swift action. Ectoplasmic Pool (Ex) : At 5th level, the phantom blade gains a reservoir of excess ethereal energy and ectoplasm that she can draw upon to improve her phantom weapon . This pool has a number of ectoplasmic points equal to half her spiritualist level + her Wisdom modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the spiritualist refreshes her daily spells. The phantom blade can spend a number of ectoplasmic points to enhance or modify her phantom weapon . As a free action, she can spend 1 point to manifest or harbor her weapon. The spiritualist can also spend 2 ectoplasmic points as a free action to allow attacks made with her phantom weapon to resolve against touch AC for 1 round. As a swift action, she can spend 2 ectoplasmic points to grant the weapon one of the following weapon special abilities for 1 minute: corrosive UE , defending, flaming, frost, keen, merciful UE , shock , or throwing . At 11th level, she can spend 3 ectoplasmic points to grant the weapon one of the following weapon special abilities for 1 minute: corrosive burst UE , disruption, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst , or unholy . At 15th level, she can spend 5 ectoplasmic points to grant the weapon one of the following weapon special abilities for 1 minute: brilliant energy, dancing , or speed . A phantom blade can spend an appropriate number of points to grant the weapon multiple abilities as one action. A phantom weapon cannot have a modified bonus higher than +10. Reshape (Ex) : At 7th level, a phantom blade can change the weapon type of her phantom weapon when she refreshes her daily spells. Phantom Tether (Su) : At 9th level, a phantom blade can spend 1 ectoplasmic point as a swift action to instantly recall her phantom weapon to her hand or consciousness from as far as 1 mile away. Quick Reshape (Ex) : At 13th level, a phantom blade can spend 1 ectoplasmic point to reshape her phantom weapon as a full-round action, 2 ectoplasmic points to reshape her weapon as a standard action, 3 ectoplasmic points to reshape her weapon as a move action, and 4 ectoplasmic points to reshape her weapon as a swift action. Etheric Strikes (Sp) : At 17th level, a phantom blade can spend 1 ectoplasmic point as a swift action to allow her phantom weapon to ignore a number of points of damage reduction equal to twice her Wisdom modifier or twice the weapon's Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. Soul Eater (Su) : At 19th level, the phantom blade and her weapon can feast on the energy of departing souls. Each time she kills a living or incorporeal creature with her phantom weapon , she can pick one of the following effects: she gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round, she recovers one 1st- or 2nd-level spell slot, or she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the phantom weapon 's ego (these temporary hit points last until lost or 1 minute, whichever is shorter). The creature killed must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than half the phantom blade's spiritualist level for this to occur.

A quintessentialist can fully manifest her exemplar as a full-round action rather than a 1-minute ritual, and she can dismiss it back into her mind as a standard action. When fully manifested, a quintessentialist can transfer any equipment she is currently wearing or carrying to her exemplar, allowing it to manifest with weapons, armor, and other equipment, but doing so removes these possessions from the quintessentialist. She can likewise grant her exemplar any feats she knows, losing access to those feats herself while the exemplar remains fully manifested. Projecting an exemplar is draining, however. A quintessentialist cannot cast any spells herself and she takes a -2 penalty to all ability scores while her exemplar is fully manifested.

If the shade moves beyond this distance, it is automatically dismissed back to the Shadow Plane (preventing the shade from being summoned back for 24 hours) unless the shadow caller concentrates as per the etheric tether ability. However, if both the shadow caller and shade are in areas of total darkness, the shade can move any distance from the shadow caller. If the shade is beyond its maximum distance and enters an area of dim or brighter illumination, it immediately returns to the Shadow Plane and cannot be summoned for 24 hours. This ability replaces etheric tether.",
        "shadow jump (su)": " At 6th level, when a shadow caller's shade inhabits her shadow, she can travel between shadows as per the shadowdancer's shadow jump ability. Each day, she can travel a total of 40 feet per spiritualist level in this way and, as with a shadowdancer, the distance is rounded to the nearest 10-foot increment. This ability replace phantom recall.",

She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, though these rounds need not be consecutive. This ability replaces see invisibility",
        "umbral aura (su, sp)": " At 10th level, a shadow caller is wreathed in an aura of darkness while her shade inhabits her shadow, gaining 50% concealment against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability. Additionally, the shadow caller's square and all adjacent squares are treated as areas of dim illumination while she benefits from this ability; this second effect counts as a 4th-level darkness spell for the purpose of adjudicating light and darkness effects. While her shade inhabits her shadow, the shadow caller can hide in plain sight, even if an observing creature has darkvision or see in darkness. This ability replaces fused consciousness.",
        "living darkness (su)": " At 20th level, a shadow caller becomes a creature of absolute darkness. When using her incorporeal bonded manifestation, she is immune to cold and mind-affecting effects and gains an incorporeal touch attack that she can use as a standard action to deal 20d6 points of negative energy damage. When the shadow caller damages a creature with this ability, she gains 5d6 temporary hit points (Fortitude half; DC = 20 + her Wisdom modifier), so long as she doesn't already have any temporary hit points gained via this ability). Temporary hit points gained this way disappear after 1 hour. This ability replaces empowered consciousness."

When this unusual circumstance happens, the spiritualist retains all the psychic potential from her time serving as a conduit and a vessel, even though she is no longer accompanied by her phantom. While some who would have otherwise become adventuring spiritualists take this as an opportunity to instead choose a normal life, others are galvanized to become wardens of the soulstream, serving Pharasma and working with psychopomps to protect vulnerable souls from those who seek to capture, corrupt, or devour them. At the GM's discretion, a spiritualist might help her phantom move on during play, and if the attempt is successful, she can apply this archetype retroactively, making the appropriate modifications to her class choices as if she had been a soul warden from first level.",
        "nosoi scribe": " At 1st level, a soul warden gains a fledgling nosoi familiar. Treat this as a raven familiar until the soul warden reaches 4th level, at which point it is treated as a nosoi (as though the soul warden had taken the Improved Familiar feat). The familiar uses the soul warden's spiritualist level as its Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the effects and duration of its haunting melody ability and all other effects related to its HD. At 10th level, the nosoi scribe gains the ability to use its touch the spirit world ability three times per day, instead of once per day. At 12th level, it also gains the Repose domain's ward against death ability. This replaces phantom, etheric tether, shared consciousness, spiritual interference, fused consciousness, and greater spiritual interference.",

While within the soul warden, the warded creature can communicate with the soul warden, and it can be targeted only by effects that could target a creature possessing another creature's body. The warded creature has no other influence over the soul warden or her body. If the soul warden is reduced below 0 hit points, the warded creature is expelled. This replaces bonded manifestation.",
        "phantom elegy (su)": " At 8th level, a soul warden's nosoi scribe learns to sing elegies that build on the soul warden's conduit to her former phantom. This allows it to create an effect identical to the 7th-level aura ability of an anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, or zeal phantom, except that the phantom elegy is also a sonic effect and continues only as long as the nosoi scribe sings. Each round of phantom elegy uses 1 round of the nosoi scribe's haunting melody. At 17th level, the nosoi scribe can blend any two of the phantom aura abilities into a single phantom elegy, although it uses 3 rounds of its haunting melody for each round it does so. This replaces bonded manifestation increases and dual bond.",

One of the few traditions to survive to the present day is that of the totem spiritualists. These specialized spiritualists call upon phantoms that are manifestations of animals and personifications of nature.",
        "phantom animal": " A totem spiritualist calls upon spirits of nature known as phantom animals to assist her in her journeys. A phantom animal functions like an animal companion except as noted in the descriptions below. A totem spiritualist begins play with a phantom animal. The phantom animal uses the statistics of an animal companion and follows the standard animal companion progression in regard to Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, skills, feats, natural armor bonus, Strength and Dexterity bonuses, and bonus tricks, but not its special abilities. A phantom animal instead gains the special abilities of a standard phantom listed in the table on page 77 of Occult Adventures . A phantom animal is capable of becoming harbored in the spiritualist's consciousness or becoming fully or partially manifested. A phantom animal is otherwise considered a phantom for the purposes of all feats and abilities. At 7th level and every 5 spiritualist levels thereafter, the totem spiritualist can choose to gain an additional phantom animal. This additional phantom animal uses the appropriate statistics for a phantom animal of its level. A totem spiritualist can have only one active phantom animal at a time. Dismissing an active phantom animal to call another requires a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. Instead of gaining an additional phantom animal, the totem spiritualist can choose to empower a phantom animal with which she is already bonded. The first time the phantom animal is empowered, it gains two bonus tricks. The second time it is empowered, the phantom animal gains the hunter's animal focus class ability ( Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27 ), treating the totem spiritualist's spiritualist level as her effective hunter level. The third time it is empowered, the damage dice of the phantom animal's natural attacks increase by one step. A totem spiritualist can release a phantom animal from her service much like a druid releases an animal companion. If a totem spiritualist releases a phantom animal from service, she can gain a new one by performing a ritual requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of meditation in an environment where the animal that the phantom resembles typically lives. A totem spiritualist treats any druid levels she has as effective spiritualist levels to determine the abilities of her phantom animals, but does not treat her spiritualist levels as effective druid levels to determine the abilities of animal companions. This ability replaces phantom.",

If her phantom animal has any of the following abilities, she gains them whenever the phantom animal is harbored in her consciousness: blindsense, darkvision, low-light vision, and scent. This ability replaces see invisibility.",
        "twin phantoms (su)": " At 17th level, the totem spiritualist can call upon two of her phantom animals at once. As a standard action, she can manifest a second phantom animal. The phantom animal remains for a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level and can be dismissed as a free action. This duration does not need to be consecutive.

Skeptics who point out the apparent contradiction that ushers of lost souls use phantoms to aid them are quickly told that their ectoplasmic allies hail from the Ethereal Plane and are not actually undead. Ushers of lost souls are common among the clergy of Pharasma and are seen throughout the Inner Sea region.",

The spiritualist can channel positive energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). She channels energy like a cleric of her spiritualist level, except the channeled energy can be used only to harm undead or haunts. This otherwise functions as channel energy for the purposes of feats and abilities. The spiritualist does not require a holy symbol to use this ability.",
        "spirit senses (ex)": " At 2nd level, an usher of lost souls gains a bonus equal to half her spiritualist level on Perception checks to detect haunts and incorporeal creatures and on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a creature is possessed, under the effects of an enchantment or curse, or otherwise magically controlled. This ability replaces bonded senses.",
        "disrupting phantom (ex)": " When an usher of lost souls reaches 4th level, her phantom gains the ability to directly harm haunts. The phantom can make an attack while within a haunt's area against an AC equal to 10 + the haunt's caster level. On a hit, the phantom deals its slam damage to the haunt; the haunt is immune to critical hits from the phantom. When an usher of lost souls reaches 12th level, her phantom can deal critical hits to a haunt, and the critical threat range for its slam attacks against haunts increases to 19-20. This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.",
        "locate haunts (su)": " At 9th level, an usher of lost souls can locate inactive haunts. As a standard action, she can enhance her vision to detect haunts within 60 feet of her. A haunt's area glows with a bright light for an untriggered haunt or dim light for a haunt that is waiting to reset. She can use this ability for 10 minutes per day per spiritualist level. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 10-minute increments. This ability replaces see invisibility",

She can use one of her uses of calm spirit OA to instead cast purge spirit OA as a spell-like ability.

        "kami phantom (su)": " The ward spiritualist's phantom is less powerful than most, but it has an innate connection to its ward. The ward spiritualist's phantom is a kami phantom, functioning as normal for a phantom, except that its base attack bonus is equal to three-quarters its Hit Dice (as a rogue) and its Hit Dice are d8s instead of d10s. Additionally, a kami phantom cannot manifest as incorporeal, only ectoplasmic. This alters phantom.",
        "ward implement (su)": " The ward spiritualist gains a single implement school of her choice, as an occultist , along with its resonant focus power and base focus power. The ward spiritualist does not gain additional spells from her ward implement, and it always starts each day with mental focus invested equal to half her class level (minimum 1). When she gains her ward implement, the ward spiritualist must choose either to have a physical implement or to be the implement herself. If she chooses to have a physical implement, her spiritualist spells include it as a focus component, and she can change what item is her implement when she regains her spells at the start of each day. Her implement must be an item that can be held in one hand, and it cannot be a manufactured weapon. If the ward spiritualist chooses to be her own ward implement, her spiritualist spells always have a somatic component in addition to their other components; this component does not become an emotion component. She can remove the focus or somatic component of her spells, but this requires a concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + twice the spell level, which is increased for a thought component as normal. She gains a focus power for her implement school at 2nd level, and again at 6th level and 12th level. She must meet the prerequisites of these focus powers, treating her spiritualist level as her occultist level for focus power prerequisites. She also treats her spiritualist level as her occultist level for feat prerequisites. This alters spellcasting and replaces bonded senses, phantom recall, and greater spiritual interference.",
        "merged manifestation (su)": " At 3rd level, the ward spiritualist learns how to merge her kami phantom with her ward implement. This functions as bonded manifestation, except that she does not choose ectoplasmic or incorporeal. Instead, she gains different benefits depending on whether she has a physical implement or is her own implement. If she has a physical implement, when using her merged manifestation, her implement functions as a one-handed improvised weapon of appropriate size, and she does not take the usual penalties associated with wielding an improvised weapon. Additionally, it is considered to have a +1 enhancement bonus for the duration of the merged manifestation. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 at 8th level, and again at 13th level and 18th level. At 8th level, and again at 18th level, it deals damage as a weapon one size category larger. At 13th level, her implement also gains the benefits of spirit-bound blade for the duration of the merged manifestation. If she is her own implement, when using her merged manifestation, she gains the unarmed strike class feature as a 1st level unchained monk . At 8th level, her unarmed strike damage is that of a 4th-level unchained monk, and she gains flurry of blows as a 1st-level unchained monk. At 13th level, her unarmed damage is that of an 8th-level unchained monk, and her unarmed strikes gain the benefits of spirit-bound blade for the duration of the merged manifestation.

In addition to an emotion, a zeitgeist is tied to one aspect of its settlement: corruption, crime, economy, law, lore, or society ( Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 204 ). In order to select an aspect, that aspect of the settlement must have a positive modifier (for instance, a settlement with a negative lore modifier or a modifier of 0 could not manifest a lore zeitgeist). Although a zeitgeist personifies a single chosen settlement, a zeitgeist binder can call it anywhere, but outside the bounds of its settlement, it loses the benefits of its settlement aspect and settlement avatar abilities. This ability alters phantom.",

As a standard action, it can project its senses out into the settlement, perceiving the general pulse of its chosen aspect throughout the whole settlement as well as anything involving its aspect that is occurring within 50 feet per spiritualist level. The sensing works like enter image APG , so the zeitgeist attempts a Perception check at a - 10 penalty to notice any particular activity within range. The zeitgeist can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to the zeitgeist binder's spiritualist level. These rounds need not be consecutive. When the zeitgeist binder reaches 10th level, the zeitgeist can project its senses to feel its settlement aspect at will. Additionally, the zeitgeist binder gains a bonus teamwork feat as long as she is in her zeitgeist's settlement. The zeitgeist binder must meet the teamwork feat's prerequisites, and she grants the feat as a bonus feat to her zeitgeist, even if it doesn't meet the prerequisites.

The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer.

Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast).

If the eidolon emerges from an injured creature, that creature takes 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if the creature succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier). The eidolon appears in its choice of the nearest unoccupied square to the creature or corpse it emerged from, and is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces transposition.",

A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect. This ability can be used once per day at 16th level, twice per day at 18th level, and three times per day at 20th level. The eidolon can end this possession at any time as a standard action.

        "eidolon brood": "  At 2nd level, instead of a single eidolon, a broodmaster summons two Small eidolons to his side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner. Each eidolon has it own base form and associated base statistics and free evolutions. Regardless of the number of eidolons in the brood, each eidolon has the same base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses, but the rest of the eidolons' base statistics must be divided between the eidolons, including Hit Dice (minimum 1), skill points, number of feats, armor bonus, Str/Dex bonus, evolution pool (but see below), and maximum number of natural attacks. Individual eidolons in the brood must purchase evolutions separately. Once a broodmaster decides on the forms and abilities of his eidolons, they cannot be changed until the summoner gains a level. Example : A 2nd-level broodmaster can summon two eidolons. Each eidolon has 1 Hit Dice, BAB +2, +3 on its two good saves and +0 on its bad save. The broodmaster decides to give the first eidolon 4 skill points, one feat, a +1 armor bonus, a +1 bonus to Strength, 2 points from the evolution pool, and a maximum of two attacks. The remaining 4 skill points, +1 armor bonus, +1 bonus to Dexterity, and 2 points from the evolution pool go to the second eidolon, but it gains no feats and can have only one natural attack. The broodmaster must dismiss all of his eidolons at one time. Likewise, all of the eidolons in a brood are banished if the broodmaster is unconscious, asleep, or killed. However, each eidolon in the brood is sent back to its home plane individually when its hit points are reduced to a negative number equal to or greater than its Constitution score. This ability replaces the summoner's normal eidolon ability. The following are new class features of the broodmaster archetype. Those with the same name as the standard summoner class have slightly different rules, but otherwise work as and replace the standard summoner class features of the same name.",

This allows him to summon two Medium eidolons, four Small eidolons, or one Medium eidolon and two Small eidolons. At 13th level, if the broodmaster has purchased the large evolution for his brood, he can spend an additional 6 evolution points from the evolution pool for the huge evolution, distributing the remaining points among his eidolons. This allows him to call two Large eidolons, four Medium eidolons, eight Small eidolons, or any similar combination in which two smaller eidolons count as one eidolon of one size larger.",

Horders of Summoned Monsters The broodmaster and master summoner archetypes can potentially have 5, 10, or even more summoned creatures in play.

This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller's summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect. The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to his summoner spell list as a 5th-level spell, but he does not automatically add them to his list of spells known. This alters the summoner's summon monster I-IX abilities.",

The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning , this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning. At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon.

If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution. At 8th level, the storm caller's eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution. At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon.

The synthesist directs all of the eidolon's actions while fused, perceives through its senses, and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature.

The synthesist gains the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is killed and sent back to its home plane. The synthesist uses the eidolon's base attack bonus, and gains the eidolon's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores.

However, the eidolon and the god caller must remain within 50 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 50 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by half. This ability alters life link.",

He makes the choice before rolling. Once per day while his eidolon uses the aid another action to assist him in such a check, if the god caller would improve a target's attitude toward him, or gain a success if using the individual influence rules ( Ultimate Intrigue 102 ), he instead improves that target's attitude by 2 steps or it counts as 2 successes.

        "source": "Pathfinder #144: Midwives to Death pg. 83 Not everyone who becomes a summoner is an intentional dabbler in the arcane arts. Soulbound summoners, as a rule, never set out to bind their soul to a dangerous and enigmatic power. Rather, they have found themselves unintentional masters of eidolons through incredible circumstances. Most common are those who forged their pacts with an outsider out of a mutual desire for self-preservation. Other soulbound summoners never contacted a true outsider at all, instead manifesting an eidolon from their minds in response to mental or magical trauma. The events that create such a summoner result in the eidolon fusing entirely to the summoner's psyche. These accidental summoners lack the practiced skill at reaching across planes that most summoners have, but their intense bond with their eidolon grants both summoner and outsider unusual power.",
        "pactbond curse (ex)": " A soulbound summoner's metaphysical connection with his eidolon has profound effects on both of them. The eidolon's alignment always matches that of the soulbound summoner, regardless of its subtype. In addition, at 1st level, the summoner must choose an oracle curse , using his summoner level as his oracle level for determining the curse's effects. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. A summoner that gains spells for his list of spells known as a result of his curse must be able to cast spells of the appropriate level in order to cast the learned spell. The glowing rune that the soulbound summoner shares with his eidolon always appears on a place symbolic of his pactbond curse. For example, a summoner who chooses the clouded vision curse might have his summoner's rune manifest on one of his eyes, while a summoner who chooses the tongues curse might have his summoner's rune appear on his lips. A soulbound summoner's eidolon is summoned from his own psyche rather than a different plane, so spells such as banishment and dismissal do not work when cast on the eidolon. This alters the eidolon class feature.",
        "soulbound life link (su)": " The essence of a soulbound summoner's eidolon resides within the summoner's mind and soul instead of a home plane, and he can use this connection to restore his eidolon with his own vitality. The summoner can use his life link ability to sacrifice any number of his hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way heals the eidolon for 1 point of damage. The soulbound summoner can use this ability even after the eidolon has been killed and sent back to its summoner's mind; if the eidolon is healed enough that its hit point total is above 0, it can be summoned again as normal. This alters life link.",
        "weakened summoning": " A soulbound summoner's eidolon is usually the result of unintended magic, trauma, or a singular pact, instead of rigorous arcane study. Soulbound summoners do not gain the ability to cast the summon monster or gate spells as a spell-like ability.",

At 11th level, and again at 15th, 17th, and 19th level, the eidolon adds 2 points to its evolution pool. At 7th level, the eidolon can select evolutions even if it does not meet the subtype requirements for that evolution. At 13th level, the eidolon can draw from its summoner's power to cast spells. The spell must be a spell that the summoner knows, and the summoner must expend two spell slots of the same spell level or higher to allow the eidolon to cast the spell. Expending spell slots in this way does not take an action. The eidolon uses the summoner's caster level, feats, and casting statistics for all spellcasting purposes. The eidolon must be able to meet all other requirements for casting the spell, such as being able to speak for spells requiring verbal components and providing any material components or focuses for spells that require them. The eidolon must be able to move its body to cast spells with somatic components, but it does not need to have the limbs (arms) evolution."

This ability alters eidolon.",

This functions as the summoner's summon monster I-IX abilities, except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated spell levels: I-eagle; II-small air elemental, small lightning elemental B2 ; III-dire bat; IV-medium air elemental, medium lightning elemental B2 , pteranodon; V-large air elemental, large lightning elemental B2 ; VI-huge air elemental, huge lightning elemental B2 ; VII-roc; VIII-elder air elemental, elder lightning elemental B2 ; IX-advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elemental B2 . Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity. Alternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action. This functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below. Each bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller's summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect. The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to his summoner spell list as a 5th-level spell, but he does not automatically add them to his list of spells known. This alters the summoner's summon monster I-IX abilities.",

The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm's fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning , this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning. At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon. This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.",
        "storm's wings (su)": " At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon's elemental might. He can gain the flight evolution ( Pathfinder Unchained 37) as though he were using the summoner's aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon's evolution pool. If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution. At 8th level, the storm caller's eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution. At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional evolutions. This ability replaces maker's call and transposition."

If the summoner's natural size is smaller than Medium, the twinned summoner's eidolon must be Small. This ability may require a different base form or subtype to match the twinned summoner's natural form, at the GM's discretion, if the twinned summoner is not a bipedal creature.",
        "teamwork feats (ex)": " At 4th level and at 12th level, a twinned summoner gains a bonus teamwork feat. He must meet the prerequisites of the selected teamwork feat. The twinned summoner automatically grants all of his teamwork feats to his eidolon. The eidolon doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats. This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.",
        "twinned transposition (su)": " At 6th level, as a standard action, a twinned summoner can swap locations with his eidolon as if each were using dimension door , using the twinned summoner's caster level. If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. If either the twinned summoner or his eidolon occupies more squares than the other, each must occupy one or more squares that were occupied by the other if possible, or as close as possible if not. The twinned summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th. At 8th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces maker's call and transposition.",

The eidolon loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. The eidolon can cast any of the summoner's spells known using the summoner's caster level and spell slots. It doesn't gain the benefit of any of the summoner's items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting. The eidolon can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to the summoner's class level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

Retaliation (Ex) : When a foe hits the arrow champion with an attack, she can spend 1 panache point to make a retaliatory attack of opportunity against that foe. If the triggering attack is a melee attack, she can retaliate with a melee attack using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, provided the creature is within her reach. If the triggering attack is a ranged attack, she can retaliate with a ranged attack using a bow, provided that the creature is within 30 feet of her. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs. This deed replaces opportune parry and riposte. Precise Aim (Ex) : At 3rd level, when attacking with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, an arrow champion can add her swashbuckler level to the damage she deals, as the swashbuckler's precise strike deed. She can also add one-quarter of her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt when attacking with a bow, but the target must be within 30 feet of her. As a swift action, an arrow champion can spend 1 panache point to increase the range of the effect to her bow's first range increment. Unlike a normal swashbuckler, an arrow champion cannot spend panache to double the extra damage. This deed alters precise strike. Swift Switch (Ex) : At 3rd level, while the arrow champion has at least 1 panache point, she can sheathe or draw an unhidden light or one-handed piercing melee weapon or a bow as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If the arrow champion spends 1 panache point, she can perform either action as an immediate action. In addition, if she has the Quick Draw feat and one of her hands is free, she can sheathe a weapon and draw an unhidden weapon as part of the same swift action, provided that one of the weapons is a bow and the other is a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If she spends 1 panache point, she can perform the switch as an immediate action. This deed replaces swashbuckler's initiative. Archer's Feint (Ex) : At 7th level, when the arrow champion hits a foe within 30 feet with a bow attack, she can forgo the damage and instead attempt a Bluff check to feint against that foe as a swift action. If successful, in addition to the normal benefits of feinting, she doubles the extra damage from precise aim on her next melee attack before the end of her next turn. This deed replaces superior feint.",

Provided that her swashbuckler level is high enough, she can use the bleeding wound, deadly stab, menacing swordplay, perfect thrust, stunning stab, and targeted strike deeds when attacking with a bow, so long as her target is within 30 feet. If she spends a panache point to increase the range of her precise aim ability, the increased range applies to this ability as well. This replaces swashbuckler weapon training.",

Whimsical Riposte (Ex) : At 3rd level, the azatariel adds her Charisma modifier to attack and damage rolls made with light or one-handed piercing weapons as part of her opportune parry and riposte deed (including when riposting). In addition, whenever the azatariel successfully parries an opponent's attack, instead of riposting she can redirect that attack to another target as an immediate action. The new target must be within the attacker's reach, and the attacker uses the original attack roll to determine the attack's success. This replaces the precise strike deed. Lillend's Misdirection (Ex) : At 7th level, when a foe flanking the azatariel misses her with a melee attack, the azatariel can spend 2 panache points as an immediate action to attempt a reposition combat maneuver check against the attacking foe. If she succeeds at the combat maneuver check, she and the attacking foe switch positions, and the melee attack roll that missed the azatariel instead targets the flanking opponent that did not make the attack, using the same attack roll result (including the bonus gained from flanking). This replaces the targeted strike deed. Ghaele's Assault (Ex) : At 11th level, the azatariel can spend 2 panache points when charging.

She can perform this deed only while wearing light armor or no armor, and she must end her movement for the round on solid ground or else fall prone. The courser can use this deed to run straight up vertical surfaces as well, but every 5 feet up counts as 10 feet of movement. This deed replaces menacing swordplay. Impossible Leap (Ex) : At 7th level, as long as the courser has at least 1 panache point and is wearing light armor or no armor, she adds her swashbuckler level on all Acrobatics checks to jump.

Swift Strikes (Ex) : At 11th level, the courser can spend 1 panache point to target two separate creatures when she uses the Spring Attack feat. She rolls the attack once and compares the result to each target's Armor Class separately. Additional damage-such as from a critical hit or weapon property-applies to only the first target struck.

The target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the dashing thief 's class level + her Charisma modifier). A creature dazed this way is immune to that dashing thief 's dazing charm deed for 24 hours. Whether or not a creature could potentially be affected by a dazing charm deed is ultimately subject to GM adjudication. As a general rule, however, it works on creatures of the dashing thief 's creature type, or on those of a different type but who share significant thematic similarities (for example, a human dashing thief could use her dazing charm deed on any humanoid, but also potentially on creatures as diverse as dryads, tieflings, or even centaurs or sphinxes).

As a standard action, she can spend 1 panache point to grant a teamwork feat she gained from this ability to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her.

For example, if an invisible enemy attacks a guiding blade's ally and the guiding blade can't see that enemy, she would not grant the bonus from interfering blade unless she had the uncanny dodge ability. This bonus does not stack with any bonus to AC the guiding blade provides with the aid another action.

The guiding blade makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the guiding blade, the guiding blade takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's attack result, the creature's attack is redirected to the guiding blade instead of the guiding blade's adjacent ally. The guiding blade must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful redirection, if the guiding blade has at least 1 panache point, the guiding blade can, as an immediate action, make an attack against the creature whose attack she redirected, provided that creature is within reach.

This movement does not count against the mouser's movement the next round, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. While the mouser is within a foe's space, she is considered to occupy her square within that foe's space.

The mouser is considered to be flanking the foe whose space she is within if she is adjacent to an ally who is also adjacent to the foe. The mouser can move within her foe's space and leave the foe's space unhindered and without provoking attacks of opportunity, but if the foe attempts to move to a position where the mouser is no longer in its space, the movement provokes an attack of opportunity from the mouser. This deed replaces opportune parry and riposte. Quick Steal (Ex) : At 3rd level, as a swift action the mouser can spend 1 panache point when she hits a for larger than her size with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the creature she hit.

Hamstring (Ex) : At 7th level, as long as a mouser has at least 1 panache point when she hits a foe whose size is larger than her own with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can as a swift action attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check.

Cat's Charge (Ex) : At 11th level, as long as a mouser has at least 1 panache point, when she charges a foe whose size is larger than her own, the mouser can end her charge in any space she can reach, not just the closest space.

        "aldori swashbuckler (ex)": " A Rostland bravo focuses on the Aldori dueling sword (see page 24), scorning the bucklers used by duelists of other styles. In addition, the relative safety and creature comforts allowed by life in the sprawling city of Restov reduces her need for athleticism. A Rostland bravo gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword) as a bonus feat. The Rostland bravo is not proficient with bucklers, and does not gain Climb or Swim as class skills. This ability alters the swashbuckler's class skills and armor proficiencies.",
        "deeds": " A Rostland bravo's training and personality set her apart from the typical swashbuckler, and as a result of these differences (as well as the impact of her Aldori training), she gains the following deeds. These deeds function only when the bravo is wielding just an Aldori dueling sword. Inevitable Victory (Ex) : The Rostland bravo's technique is all about flair; a display of her skill is enough to make any Restov brawler reconsider picking a fight. At 3rd level, the Rostland bravo gains Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. She can activate its effect only while wielding an Aldori dueling sword, and she must spend 1 panache point to do so. This deed replaces menacing swordplay. Sweeping Wind Feint (Ex) : At 7th level, the Rostland bravo masters an exotic feinting style, tossing her blade to the other hand and performing a sweeping attack or upward slash before the opponent reacts. Once per round, she can spend 1 point of panache to attempt a feint as a swift action. This deed replaces superior feint. Dragon's Rage (Ex) : At 11th level, the Rostland bravo can cast aside restraint in favor of a blindingly fast assault of unpredictable strikes inspired in part by the overwhelming brutality of a dragon in combat. Once per round as part of a full attack, the bravo can spend 1 panache point to make an additional attack with her Aldori dueling sword at her highest attack bonus. If she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with this additional attack, she regains 2 panache points rather than the normal 1 point she would gain from striking a killing blow. This deed replaces bleeding wound. Terror of the Great Wyrm (Ex) : At 15th level, the Rostland bravo can use her inevitable victory deed as part of a full attack or dragon's rage. If a creature demoralized in this way would be shaken for 3 or more rounds, the Rostland bravo can make the target frightened for 1 round before becoming shaken for the appropriate duration. This deed replaces swashbuckler's edge."

In magical fog, she can see normally for 10 feet; after that, creatures and objects have partial concealment for the next 10 feet and total concealment thereafter.

At 7th level, as a full-round action she can make a single attack with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon against a foe that is either shaken or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. If the attack hits, the Shackles corsair also pilfers a small, loose item from her target as if she had succeeded at a Sleight of Hand or steal combat maneuver check.

Hidden Blade (Ex) At 3rd level, whenever she has at least 1 panache point, a veiled blade can hide any light or onehanded piercing melee weapon using Sleight of Hand, and she receives a +4 insight bonus on her check to hide the weapon. This deed replaces the menacing swordplay deed. Instant Unveil (Ex) At 7th level, when she uses her swashbuckler's initiative deed to draw a light or onehanded piercing weapon as part of an initiative check, she can draw that weapon even if it is hidden.

Soul Veil (Sp) At 15th level, a veiled blade can merge a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon with herself, as if using the spell ghost brand , except that it takes only a swift action to manifest or store the weapon.

As a fullround action, she can spend 1 panache point to move up to her speed. She can make attacks against creatures with her reach during this movement, up to the number of attacks she's entitled to with a full attack. Each attack is made at her highest attack bonus, and must target a different creature. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This deed replaces superior feint and targeted strike. Dance of Dawn (Ex) : At 11th level, whenever a whirling dervish is in conditions of dim light or brighter and hits with a melee attack, she can spend 1 panache point to ref lect the light off her blade into the eyes of her target. That opponent is blinded for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the whirling dervish's class level + her Dexterity modifier) negates this effect. This deed replaces bleeding wound. Dance of Mercy (Ex) : At 19th level, when a whirling dervish confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, in addition to the normal damage, she can spend 1 panache point to inflict a deadly stab. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the dervish's class level + her Dexterity modifier) or take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to its current hit points + 1, as well as becomes paralyzed for 1 hour.

Adroit Step (Ex) : At 3rd level, a wildstrider can use a swift action to treat a 5-foot square of difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain. If she also spends a panache point, she can treat all difficult terrain as though it were normal terrain until the end of her turn. This deed replaces kip-up. Keen Gaze (Ex) : At 11th level, while a wildstrider has at least 1 panache point, she can ignore the miss chance from concealment (but not total concealment) caused by normal and magical fog, smoke, and undergrowth, but not other sources of concealment or a miss chance, such as blur This deed replaces subtle blade."

Many of these trace back to the agathiel tradition, first stolen from agathion celestials by the elves of Kyonin and again later by Old-Mage Jatembe. Agathiels surrender a portion of their immortal souls to Nirvana in exchange for a measure of animalistic might to aid them in their righteous crusades. This exchange is permanent, and each agathiel commits the rest of his mortal life to service of others and the constant thrum of wild instincts. Though agathiels can be found in small numbers all over Golarion, the rituals to transform a mortal into an agathiel are common only in Kyonin and the Mwangi city-states, and among the wandering scholars of the Mwangi Expanse. The elves in particular relied upon these abilities to scout Golarion before reclaiming their abandoned territories after the Age of Darkness, leading to reports of extraordinary fey animals stalking elven ruins in the century before their return.",

If either of the agathiel's alignments moves outside this range (because of his own actions or magical manipulation), he gains 1 permanent negative level and loses the ability to assume his vigilante identity until both of his alignments are within one step of neutral good.

The vigilante can attempt to appear to be a normal member of this animal type, but doing so imposes a -10 penalty on his Disguise check. The bonus provided by seamless guise still applies to the vigilante's attempts to appear to be an ordinary animal. Once the vigilante's animal form is selected, it cannot be changed. Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I , except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell's description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I , an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel's vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel's equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity. At 8th level, when assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I , or select a single ability provided by beast shape II . At 12th level, he can instead select two abilities provided by beast shape II , or a single ability provided by beast shape III . At 16th level, he can instead select three abilities provided by beast shape III , or a single ability provided by beast shape IV This ability alters dual identity and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.",

The range increases to 60 feet if the creature is upwind and drops to 15 feet if the creature is downwind.

        "brute form (ex)": " Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities. While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute's vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a -2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute's vigilante identity can't always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time). A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities. A brute's mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal). A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can't remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion. An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour. This ability replaces vigilante specialization.",
        "brute talents": " A brute can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents. Awesome Blow (Ex) : The brute has learned that his body is his most formidable weapon. He gains the Awesome Blow monster feat as a bonus feat, but only while in his vigilante identity. He can ignore the feat's prerequisites. His awesome blow combat maneuver deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 plus his Strength modifier, or his unarmed strike damage, whichever is better. At 16th level, the brute can use Awesome Blow against a creature of any size, and he can bull rush, drag APG , reposition APG , and trip creatures of any size. A brute must be at least 8th level to select this talent. Heavy Punches (Ex) : The brute eschews civilized combat and prefers to wade into a fight with his fists swinging. While in his vigilante identity, the brute's unarmed strikes deal damage as if he were a monk of his size and vigilante level. If he has levels in other classes that provide monk advancement for unarmed strike damage, his vigilante level stacks with those levels whenever he is in his vigilante identity. Scale Surroundings (Ex) : Instead of letting physical barriers stop him, the brute can simply climb over them. He gains a climb speed of 30 feet when he is in his vigilante identity. A brute must be at least 4th level to select this talent. Sizing Equipment (Ex) : The brute has learned how to adjust his magic armor so that it provides him some protection while in his vigilante identity. Magic armor the brute wears that is sized for his social identity provides an armor bonus equal to its normal armor bonus - 1 while he is in his vigilante identity. In addition, wielding a magic weapon properly sized for his social identity deals damage as if it were a magic weapon properly sized for his vigilante identity, but it imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls. At 6th level, he takes no penalties when using such weapons and armor, and his weapons and armor work in all ways (including damage dice) as if they were of the vigilante's new size. This talent only applies to magic arms and armor; inappropriately sized mundane arms and armor are not affected. Total Destruction (Ex) : The brute is adept at rampaging through an area, throwing whatever is available at his opponents. The brute gains Throw Anything as a bonus feat. As a standard action, while in his vigilante identity, he can throw any unattended object up to two size categories smaller than he is up to 60 feet if he is Medium and 80 feet if he is Large. This deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage if he is Medium or 1d8 if he is Large, and the brute adds 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier to this damage. At 8th level, he can also throw a creature up to two size categories smaller than himself, but he must succeed at a combat maneuver check against that creature's CMD to do so. The thrown creature lands prone and takes an amount of damage equal to the damage dealt to the target of the throw (as noted above), whether the brute hits or misses. At 16th level, he can instead throw an object one size category larger than himself at creatures within a 10-foot radius from the object's point of impact. These creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brute's vigilante level + his Strength modifier) or take 1d6 points of damage per vigilante level.",
        "tear them apart (ex)": " At 20th level, a brute has learned how to tear at his enemies' bodies when he hits with multiple attacks. When he takes a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, if a brute hits an opponent with at least two attacks, he deals an additional 1d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. If he hits an opponent with four attacks during a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, he instead deals an additional 3d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. The damage occurs after he has taken his last attack with the full attack action. This counts as a rend and does not stack with other abilities that grant rend. This ability replaces vengeance strike."

The amount of bleed damage is equal to the cabalist's level. A cabalist can't deal this bleed damage to a creature with total concealment. This ability replaces vigilante specialization.",
        "cabalist talents": " A cabalist can select from the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents. Bond of Blood (Sp, Su) : The cabalist has a magical bond to life-giving blood. When the cabalist deals bleed damage or 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage to an adjacent living creature, he gains 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour, and the cabalist can't gain temporary hit points again from bond of blood during that hour (even if he loses all the temporary hit points from bond of blood before that time). The number of temporary hit points gained increases by 1d6 for every 4 vigilante levels he has. At 4th level, the cabalist can also activate blood armor ACG once per day as a spell-like ability as a swift action. Familiar (Ex) : The cabalist gains a familiar, using his vigilante level as his effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though cabalists with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them. Living Shadow (Sp) : Once per day, the cabalist can become a living shadow as though he were using shadow body OA . This effect lasts for 1 round per vigilante level, and the cabalist can't cast spells while in this form. At 14th level, the cabalist can remain as a living shadow for 1 minute per vigilante level instead, and can cast spells while he is a living shadow. A cabalist must be at least 12th level to select this talent. Necromantic Focus (Ex) : The cabalist gains Spell Focus (necromancy) as a bonus feat. He also adds additional spells to his spellbook from the following list, provided he can cast spells of the appropriate level: 1st- cause fear , 2nd- blindness/deafness , 3rd- bestow curse , 4th- poison , 5th- feast on fear ACG , 6th- slay living Shadow Jump (Su) : The cabalist gains the shadowdancer's shadow jump ability with an effective shadowdancer level equal to his vigilante level - 6. If he has levels in shadowdancer, those levels stack with his vigilante levels to determine the total distance per day he can shadow jump (to a maximum of 320 feet per day). A cabalist must be at least 10th level to select this talent. Tattoo Chamber (Su) : The cabalist can magically absorb items through a tattoo on his hand or wrist and easily retrieve them or activate their magical abilities without making them manifest. The items seemingly disappear into the tattoo, but actually enter an extradimensional space that the cabalist can access via the tattoo. Stowing an item in this way requires a full-round action, and the space can store one item plus one additional item per 3 vigilante levels he has. These items must be items the cabalist can hold in one hand. Retrieving a stowed item requires mentally activating the tattoo as a swift action. The item appears in the cabalist's hand, so worn items must still be donned to gain their benefits. The cabalist can also activate any spell-trigger abilities of a stored item as though he were wielding the item, producing the magic effect from his tattoo rather than from the item. If the cabalist dies while items are within his tattoo chamber, those items fade into existence within 5 feet of the corpse.",
        "bloodbound spell (ex)": " At 5th level, a cabalist gets an advantage when casting spells against bleeding foes. Whenever the cabalist casts a spell against a foe that is taking bleed damage, the foe takes a -1 penalty on its saving throw against the spell (or to its AC if the spell requires an attack roll). This penalty increases to -2 if the spell is from the necromancy school. This ability replaces startling appearance.",
        "bloody horror (ex)": " At 11th level, when a cabalist casts a spell and one of the targets (or one creature in the area for an area spell) is taking bleed damage, the cabalist can, as a free action, make an Intimidate check to demoralize all targets of the spell (or all creatures in the area for an area spell). The cabalist rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that cabalist's bloody horror for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This ability replaces frightening appearance.",
        "shadowy appearance (sp)": " At 17th level, a cabalist becomes cloaked in shadow while in his vigilante identity. He gains a continuous 20% miss chance (as per blur). The cabalist can deactivate or reactivate this effect as a standard action. Once per day, he can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of greater invisibility for 1d6 rounds. This ability replaces stunning appearance."

On a hit, the beam deals 4d6 points of fire damage. At 18th level, the beam damage increases to 8d6 points of fire damage. This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 12th level."

A darklantern's vigilante identity must be chaotic evil, but her social identity can be more than one step removed from this alignment. Transforming back into the darklantern's social identity requires a move action. However, a darklantern must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of hours she has been in her vigilante identity) in order to successfully transform back into her social identity; otherwise, the move action is wasted and the action cannot be attempted for 1 minute.

When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer must choose a group, organization, or social structure he wishes to infiltrate (such as the beggars in Egorian's Cheapside or the city's congregation of the Midnight Temple to Asmodeus), and the fictional identity he creates must be a recruit, ally, or prospective employee of that group. This fictional identity's alignment must be within one step from either his vigilante or his social identity. A faceless enforcer can use social and vigilante talents when in his fictional identity, but he risks exposing his secret when he does so. When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer creates mundane records that can verify his fictional identity. While he is in his fictional identity, a faceless enforcer appears to be an otherwise ordinary member of his race, and he receives a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be the fictional person he says he is. He must create the appearance for this fictional identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. If the faceless enforcer changes from his vigilante identity to his fictional identity and vice versa, changing identities takes him the normal amount of time to don or remove his armor (see the armored juggernaut ability). If he changes from his fictional identity to his social identity and vice versa, it takes him 1 minute. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the fictional identity work as normal if the faceless enforcer is in his fictional identity. Otherwise, it reveals a random member of the group he is attempting to infiltrate. At 11th level, the faceless enforcer's bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be his fictional identity increases to +20. Any spell or ability designed to locate the fictional individual while the faceless enforcer is in that identity has a 50% chance of instead finding a random member of the group. Although this ability does not give the faceless enforcer any special knowledge of the group outside what he gleans himself, the faceless enforcer's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional guise. At 17th level, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the faceless enforcer's fictional identity always reveal a random member of the group he has infiltrated. Furthermore, his bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional identity increases to +15. Every month, a faceless enforcer can create a new fictional identity, if he wishes, but not another fictional identity that is attempting to infiltrate the same group.

Additionally, when a Half-Elf double scion switches from one identity to another, he is representing different aspects of his heritage rather than personality. As a result, a Half-Elf double scion has the same alignment in both of his identities. This alters dual identity.",

Elven Weapon Command (Ex) : A Half-Elf double scion can wield traditional elven weapons as well as elves can. The Half-Elf double scion treats any weapon with the word 'elven' in its name as a martial weapon, and gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat for one such weapon. Arrogant Strike (Ex) : A Half-Elf double scion has a highly confident style in battle, characteristic of both humans and elves. A Half-Elf double scion can declare that he is using this ability at the beginning of his turn as a free action. He automatically confirms any critical hits until the beginning of his next turn. He can use this ability once per day plus one additional time at 14th level and 18th level. A Half-Elf double scion must be at least 10th level to select this talent. Slick Step (Ex) : A Half-Elf double scion can, as a move action, move 10 feet without provoking an attack of opportunity. This movement cannot pass through an opponent's square and must otherwise be a legal movement. He cannot draw a weapon during this movement."

In addition, he can prevent a creature entangled or grappled in his noose from lying by tightening the noose, as per a single-target zone of truth (the caster level equals his vigilante level; the save DC is Charisma-based).

Often forming secret networks with fanciful names, they focus on destabilizing nations with blackmail, slander, and treachery.",
        "slander (ex)": " At 1st level, an imperial agent becomes an expert at spreading malicious rumors in order to foment chaos and strife to further his aims. Slandering an individual or organization takes 1d4 days in a settlement smaller than a town, or 1 week in a town or larger settlement. The imperial agent must succeed at either a Bluff or Diplomacy check. If the general populace is indifferent towards the target of the slander, the DC of this check is 20 + the target's Charisma modifier. For each step above indifferent the public's attitude towards the target is, the DC increases by 5, and for each step below indifferent the public's attitude towards the target is, the DC decreases by 5. If the imperial agent is successful, the public's attitude toward his target is decreased by 1 step. If the imperial agent fails the check, however, he cannot affect the settlement with this ability for 1 week, and the target of his slander becomes aware that someone is spreading malicious rumors. The GM determines the exact effects of the public's shift in attitude. Even if the public is hostile toward the target, they might not act openly against the target, especially if doing so might be dangerous. This replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.",

This functions identically to the many guises social talent, except that the false flag identity is associated with a particular nation, organization, or other faction. The imperial agent gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of that faction against creatures who are unaffiliated with that faction, potentially allowing the imperial agent to pin the blame for his actions on the faction he was impersonating. However, the imperial agent receives no bonus and a -10 penalty on Disguise checks against members of the faction he is impersonating. An imperial agent can choose a different faction each time he uses this ability. Factions that lack a flag, uniform, or other symbol of membership may be difficult or impossible to impersonate, at the GM's discretion. This replaces the social talent gained at 5th level."

A magical child's selection of spells is extremely limited; use Table 1-5: Summoner Spells Known on page 27 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained to determine how many spells the magical child knows at each level.

A magical child can normally transform between her identities in 5 rounds, though this improves to a standard action with the quick change social talent and a swift action with the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation is quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions.",
        "animal guide (ex)": " A magical child starts play with a magical spirit guide in the form of a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though vigilantes with outlandish familiars might still need to hide the familiar. At 3rd level, the magical child's familiar reveals another aspect of its form, and its vigilante identity changes into a creature on the Improved Familiar list that would be available to a 3rd-level spellcaster (the animal guide's social identity always remains as the original normal animal). The familiar can change its vigilante identity again when the magical child reaches 5th and 7th level, each time to familiars available at those levels. The Improved Familiar feat's alignment restrictions apply to this ability, but only the magical child's vigilante identity needs to have an alignment that fulfills the alignment requirements of the improved familiar. The familiar's new vigilante form choices are permanent, and it cannot transform back into its former vigilante identities until 9th level, when the familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn't already have it. It can use this ability at will when in its vigilante identity to transform into any of its four vigilante identities. In vigilante form, a magical child's familiar gains an amount of DR/magic equal to her vigilante level. This doesn't stack with any DR/magic that her vigilante form might already possess. If a magical child's familiar dies, its consciousness simply leaves its body, and the magical child can replace its body after 24 hours. To do so, she must conduct an 8-hour ritual that costs 200 gp per her vigilante level, but once the ritual is complete, the familiar returns in a new body. It retains all of its memories from its earlier service to the magical child. This ability replaces vigilante specialization.",

        "source": "Adventurer's Guide pg. 82 In the wake of Ileosa's death, some of the surviving Gray Maidens attempted to return to their former lives-a task made difficult by the physical and emotional scars of their indoctrination. For a few, suppressing the indoctrination's effects seemed to work. In time, though, the repressed aspects returned, pushing these former conscripts to don their armor and seek out conflict. These so-called masked maidens find themselves leading a double life: ordinary (albeit troubled) citizen by day, faceless warrior by night. In the most tragic cases, the identities entirely disassociate, with the maiden experiencing unexplained exhaustion and injuries upon awakening. While their social identities cover a wide range of personality types, in their vigilante identities, masked maidens are usually icy and dispassionate. These identities are rarely good-aligned, and are more often merciless bringers of justice than gentle redeemers. Some masked maidens continue enforcing the queen's cruel agenda, while others fight crime or pursue personal vendettas. A masked maiden always uses the iconic Gray Maiden helm when in her vigilante identity, as these helms serve excellently at both hiding the vigilante's identity while simultaneously evoking the significant social gravitas associated with the Gray Maidens. Often, the masked maiden wears signature garb, such as a helm with a distinctively colored plume or a scarlike etching on the helm's face, or perhaps a unique cloak. Although the masked maiden hides behind the armor and is pursuing her goals, she wants to be able to be identified as a specific individual.",

The masked maiden always starts the day in her social identity. To begin willingly changing to her vigilante identity, the masked maiden must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half her vigilante level); if she fails, she becomes shaken for 1 minute and cannot try again during that time. While in her social identity, when the masked maiden is exposed to mortal peril (such as when combat starts), she must succeed at a Will save at the same DC or be compelled to enter her vigilante identity as soon as she can get out of sight to do so. The masked maiden cannot choose to fail this Will save. In addition, if the masked maiden hasn't entered her vigilante identity for a week or longer, she must attempt this Will save at the start of each day; on a failure, she is compelled to change into her vigilante identity immediately (or as soon as she can slip out of sight to do so). A masked maiden can don Gray Maiden plate in 1 minute without aid, and can do so as part of switching to her vigilante identity. If the maiden reduces the time it takes to change identities (such as with the quick change social talent), she can still don her armor as part of changing to her vigilante identity. A masked maiden who changes to her vigilante identity unwillingly can't choose to switch from her vigilante identity back to her social identity that day. While in her vigilante identity, the masked maiden takes a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based ability and skill checks (except for Intimidate) and can't benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances. This ability alters dual identity.",

The masked maiden can spend 150 gp and 1 day of work to improve her battered armor to masterwork quality (although it is still considered battered). This ability replaces seamless guise.",

The mounted fury always requires 1 minute to change identities, regardless of other effects that reduce the time required, and he cannot choose the immediate change or quick change social talents. This alters dual identity.",
        "mount (ex)": " A mounted fury gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the mounted fury's vigilante level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium mounted fury can select a camel or a horse. A Small mounted fury can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. A mounted fury can exchange or replace his mount the same way that a druid exchanges or replaces her animal companion. A mounted fury does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A mounted fury's mount does not gain the share spells ability. A mounted fury's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. At 3rd level, the mounted fury's mount shares all his teamwork feats, without needing to meet the prerequisites (although while mounted, the mounted fury and his mount do not count as separate creatures for the purpose of these feats). At 5th level, the mounted fury's mount benefits from the vigilante's startling appearance as if it were the vigilante. Should a mounted fury's mount die, the mounted fury may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link or devotion special abilities until the next time the mounted fury gains a level. A mounted fury can select avenger vigilante talents, despite not being an avenger. He can also select a teamwork feat for which he qualifies in place of a vigilante talent; at 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat each time he does so (if he selected any teamwork feats in place of vigilante talents before 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat at 10th level for each time he did so).

This functions as the elemental ray bloodline power (from the elemental sorcerer bloodline) and uses his vigilante level as his sorcerer level. The mutated defender chooses the damage type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) of his mutant blast when selecting this talent. The mutated defender must be at least 9th level to select this talent. Mutant Evolution : The mutated defender gains a 1-point evolution from the eidolon list other than climb, improved natural armor, mount, skilled, or swim.

He can select an evolution granting a natural attack without fulfilling the subtype requirement, though he must replace one of his hands with the natural weapon. A mutated defender can select this mutant talent multiple times, choosing a different evolution each time. Mutated Lobe (Sp) : A mutated defender's brain is enlarged and distended, granting him psychic powers.

This implement school does not allow the psychometrist to cast any spells of that school of magic, though, and he can't use spell-trigger or spell-completion magic items from any schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. A psychometrist can't select an implement school more than once. The psychometrist treats his vigilante level as his occultist level for purposes of determining how his implements' focus powers work, and for determining at what level he may choose certain focus powers. Unlike an occultist, each of a psychometrist's focus powers has its own associated implement or gadget. For example, a psychometrist might own a scabbard implement to use the legacy weapon focus power and an implement that is a pair of boots to use the sudden speed focus power. The psychometrist must assign mental focus separately to each implement each day, and he doesn't gain resonant powers his implements. Otherwise, this ability acts like the occultist's implements class feature. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the psychometrist learns to use one additional implement school. Each time a psychometrist learns an implement school, he learns the base focus power from that school, plus one focus power from each implement school he has previously learned (but not from the new school he just learned). The psychometrist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see below). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the psychometrist's vigilante level + the psychometrist's Intelligence modifier. The psychometrist can select a school he already knows, and in this case, he gains a total of two new focus powers from that school (instead of learning the base focus power from the new school). This replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.",

      "Splintersoul": {
        "source": "Antihero's Handbook pg. 17 A splintersoul pushes the boundaries of what it means to have two separate identities. One may be kind and calm while the other is angry and heartless, and the change from one identity to another is sudden and frightening. The splintersoul is torn by conflicting emotions and thoughts, but because of his dual mind, he can master a uniquely disparate set of skills and abilities no normal person should be able to manage.",
        "splintered identity (ex)": " A splintersoul's two identities are even more distant from one another than those of a normal vigilante. He cannot use any of his vigilante talents while in his social identity. However, for the purpose of qualifying for classes, feats, and other abilities, he is eligible if one of his alignments meets the requirements. While in an identity whose alignment is incompatible with an ability, class, or feat, he temporarily loses access to the feat or ability or is treated as an ex-member of the class, as appropriate. For example, a splintersoul with barbarian levels, a lawful-good social identity, and a neutral vigilante identity can't use his vigilante talents or his rage class feature while in his social identity, but he regains these abilities and can use them as normal as soon as he changes to his vigilante identity. A splintersoul with paladin levels must follow the paladin's normal code of conduct while in a lawful-good identity, but while in an identity with a different alignment, the following changes apply to his code: Willingly committing an evil act (for example, casting a spell with the evil descriptor) still causes the vigilante to become an ex-paladin, but otherwise, he can do whatever else he feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good. He should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of his faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of his code. At the GM's discretion, other classes or archetypes with similarly strict codes of conduct can also follow a less strict version of a code of conduct while in an identity with an incompatible alignment. This alters dual identity.",
        "sudden change (ex)": " More adaptive than other vigilantes, a splintersoul must select the quick change social talent at 3rd level and the immediate change social talent at 7th level, ignoring the minimum levels for those talents.

        "surprising change (ex)": " At 7th level, when a splintersoul uses the immediate change talent to reveal his vigilante identity and then attacks a foe in the same round, he can use the startling appearance ability against that foe as though the foe were unaware of his presence. At 11th and 17th levels, he can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance, respectively, while using this ability. A splintersoul can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance only against foes who are unaware of his presence, and he can do so a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier. This ability doesn't function against foes who already know the splintersoul's identity. This alters startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance."

        "mystic bolts (su)": " A warlock can sling projectiles of magical energy at will by shooting a bolt or touching her foe. A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 for every 4 vigilante levels the warlock has. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock's normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they're excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn't apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts. Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn't attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can't affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts. At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above. Each time she creates a mystic bolt, she can have it use any one of the damage types she has selected. This ability replaces vigilante specialization.",

She makes this choice each time she activates Arcane Strike, and it lasts for the same duration. At 16th level, she adds anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, and unholy to the list of special abilities she can select. She can choose to apply an alignment-based weapon special ability only while in her vigilante identity, and only if it matches the alignment of her vigilante identity. Elemental Armor (Su) : When in her vigilante identity, the warlock gains armor made of elemental energy. She is surrounded by a nimbus of ice, lightning, or flames, granting her resistance 5 to cold, electricity, or fire, respectively. The damage type must be chosen when she selects this talent, and it can't be changed. At 4th level, the warlock's armor deals 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type to any creature striking the warlock with a natural weapon or a non-reach melee weapon. A creature that attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against the warlock also takes this damage. A creature can take damage in this way no more than once per round. At 8th level, the energy resistance increases to 10. At 12th level, the damage increases to 2d6 points. At 16th level, the warlock becomes immune to the chosen damage type while in her vigilante identity. Familiar (Ex) : The warlock gains a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though warlocks with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them. Social Simulacrum (Sp) : The warlock can create a shortlived simulacrum (as lesser simulacrum on page 238 of Ultimate Magic ) that duplicates her social identity, allowing her to appear to be in two places at once. Creating the duplicate takes 1 hour and requires no material component cost. It lasts for 4 hours before turning back into an inert pile of snow. The duplicate replicates only the warlock's social identity, with the same alignment and social talents. It has no magical abilities, and can't assume a vigilante identity. As with the spell, the simulacrum isn't under the warlock's control. The warlock can create a social simulacrum no more than once per day and can have only one in existence at a time.

These vigilantes have ties to the creature whose abilities they emulate, whether from a distant lycanthrope ancestor, a divine touch, unnatural experimentation, or something else altogether.",
        "natural course (ex)": " At first level, when a wildsoul chooses a vigilante specialization, he must also choose a natural course: arachnid, falconine, or ursine. This represents the type of creature that influences his body, granting him his remarkable abilities. Once this choice is made, it can't be changed. At 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, a wildsoul gains a specific ability tied to his natural course. These abilities count as vigilante talents, as onlookers who see the wildsoul in his social identity use them overtly might suspect him of being something more than he appears; the more obvious animalistic abilities (like bear form and shoot webs) impart a -10 penalty on the wildsoul's Disguise check to appear as his social identity. This alters vigilante specialization and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.",
        "arachnid": " These wildsouls have the blood of spiders running through their veins. Heightened Senses (Ex) : At 2nd level, an arachnid wildsoul can anticipate physical danger and react astonishingly quickly. He gains the stalker sense vigilante talent, even if he is not a stalker. Shoot Webs (Ex) : At 6th level, an arachnid wildsoul's wrists can produce thick, sticky webbing that he can shoot at his enemies. Shooting webbing is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. The webbing acts as a tanglefoot bag when it hits a creature, except the DC of the Reflex save to avoid being glued to the floor or unable to fly is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arachnid wildsoul's vigilante level + his Constitution modifier. Like a tanglefoot bag, the webbing does not work underwater. The arachnid wildsoul can shoot webs a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier. Web Specialist (Ex) : At 12th level, an arachnid wildsoul can coat his hands and feet in super-sticky webbing, even over equipment such as gloves and boots. This gives him a climb speed of 30 feet. Additionally, as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an arachnid wildsoul can use his webbing to create the equivalent of a 50-foot length of silk rope (hp 4, break DC 24) and can shoot it at any flat, unoccupied surface that is at least one 5-foot square in size. If the arachnid wildsoul succeeds at a ranged attack against AC 10, the rope sticks fast to the surface, can only be removed if it is destroyed, and can support the weight of the arachnid wildsoul plus one additional Medium or smaller creature. If more creatures attempt to use the webbing rope, it is destroyed. This costs a daily use of shoot webs. Web Master (Ex) At 18th level, an arachnid wildsoul can use web specialist without spending a daily use of shoot webs. Additionally, he can create numerous web-ropes as he is moving and swing from rope to rope, essentially allowing him to move at his base speed through the air as long as he always uses at least one hand to hold the webbing and continues to have tether points within 50 feet and above him. The web ropes he creates in this way dissolve as soon as he is done using them to swing.",
        "falconine": " These wildsouls have the blood of falcons or other large birds of prey running through their veins. Soft Landing (Ex) : At 2nd level, a falconine wildsoul can grow feathery wing-flaps under his arms that allow him to fall slowly. He gains the perfect fall vigilante talent. Eagle Eye (Ex) At 6th level, a falconine wildsoul hones his visual senses. He gains a competence bonus equal to half his vigilante level on visual Perception checks. Take to the Air (Ex) At 12th level, a falconine wildsoul can harness the flight inherent in his blood. While in his vigilante identity, he has feathery wings that grant him a fly speed of 40 feet (with good maneuverability). Deadly Dive (Ex) : At 18th level, a falconine wildsoul has learned how to mimic the swooping and diving of birds of prey. As a full-round action while he is flying at least 30 feet above the ground, a falconine wildsoul can dive onto a creature by moving up to twice his fly speed and make a single melee attack. The movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and the attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the attack's target. If the attack is successful, the falconine wildsoul deals the attack's damage plus 2d6 points of damage for every 10 feet he dove (to a maximum of 20d6 damage if he dove 100 feet or more). Even if the attack misses, the target still takes the extra damage for the distance of the dive, but it receives a Reflex save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the falconine wildsoul's vigilante level + his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher). A falconine vigilante can dive in this way a number of times per day equal to his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher.",
        "ursine": " These wildsouls have the blood of bears running through their veins. Deadly Claws (Ex) : At 2nd level, an ursine wildsoul's hands become claws in his vigilante identity, granting him two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small. Bear Jaws (Ex) : At 6th level, an ursine wildsoul gains a bite attack while in his vigilante identity. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small. Thick Hide (Ex) : At 12th level, an ursine wildsoul in his vigilante identity has skin that bristles with thick hair like that of a bear's. He gains a natural armor bonus of +1. This natural armor bonus increases by 1 at 16th and 20th levels. Bear Form (Su) : At 18th level, an ursine wildsoul has learned how to take a bear's form. He can change into bear form as a standard action, at will, and the transformation lasts until he changes back. While transformed, he becomes a grizzly bear (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 31) as beast shape II. An ursine wildsoul loses his ability to speak while in bear form and is limited to the sounds that a normal bear can make, though he can communicate normally with other bears, as speak with animal.",

Feline Attributes (Ex) : At 2nd level, a feline wildsoul gains the low-light vision and scent special abilities and reduces any penalty he takes on Perception checks due to distance by an amount equal to 1/2 his vigilante level (minimum 0). If he also gains low-light vision or scent from a feat or racial trait, he instead gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks for each ability he already has. In addition, he can take Aspect of the Beast APG , ignoring the feat's prerequisites. Feline Grace (Ex) : At 6th level, a feline wildsoul gains uncanny dodge, using his vigilante level as his effective rogue level. At 12th level, he also gains improved uncanny dodge. Feline Pounce (Ex) : At 12th level, a feline wildsoul can strike quickly and lethally at a moment's notice. He gains the mad rush avenger vigilante talent, even if he is not an avenger. Nine Lives (Su) : At 18th level, a feline wildsoul can survive attacks that would kill lesser vigilantes.

If good in his vigilante identity (or if he worships a good deity), the vigilante channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures.

Once this choice is made, it can't be reversed. Discern Lies (Sp) : The zealot can use discern lies as a spell-like ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his vigilante level. The rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. A zealot must be 6th level before taking this talent. Empower Symbol (Su) : As a standard action, the zealot can empower his holy symbol.

If the zealot is of evil alignment in his vigilante identity (or worships an evil deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecrate effect. If the zealot is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecrate or desecrate , but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the consecration or desecration effects. A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent. Stalwart (Ex) : A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn't gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent. Stern Gaze (Ex) : A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1). Zealot Smite (Su) : Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity's. Once that choice is made, it can't be changed. As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot's smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot's smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot's smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot's smite attacks bypass the creature's DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus. At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level."

Acid Rain : A brief rain shower deals acid damage to the target square, with a Fortitude save for half damage.

Blizzard : Hail deals cold damage to the target square, with a Fortitude save for half damage. A creature that fails its save against an enhanced blizzard is blinded for 1 round. Deadfall : A tree branch, stone boulder, or other heavy object falls on the target square. A deadfall deals bludgeoning damage, with a Reflex save for half damage.

He casts these as divine warpriest spells: 1st- charm person , rally point APG , wrath APG ; 2nd- castigate APG , heroism , suggestion ; 3rd- charm monster , geas (lesser) ; 4th- forced repentance APG , serenity UM ; 5th- castigate (mass) APG , suggestion (mass) ; 6th- antipathy , sympathy This ability replaces sacred armor and the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.",

        "blessing of conversion": "  The proselytizer always gains the conversion bonus upon converting an NPC, rather than only the first time he does so each level. The bonuses overlap their durations, and do not stack. The proselytizer does not gain access to the minor blessings granted by his blessing class feature until 3rd level. This ability modifies blessings.",
        "voice of the faithful (ex)": "  A proselytizer of 10th level or higher can expend a use of his major blessing to be able to speak to and understand any creature with a language for 1 hour. This ability modifies blessings (major). Converting NPCs Cohorts and their masters often share alignment, but a common religion can be just as important. A cohort may share a leader's faith when first recruited, or a PC may seek to convert a cohort as their relationship develops. While PCs may choose to change alignment, such changes for NPCs may require magical assistance (see the atonement spell). Alternatively, you can proselytize for your patron deity, using your powers of persuasion and social inf luence to indoctrinate an NPC in the dogma of the faith while inspiring their fealty. Converting an NPC to your faith is similar to modifying their reaction with Diplomacy. You can only attempt to convert NPCs who are at least indifferent toward you, though you can take time to make a hostile or unfriendly NPC indifferent, and then begin the process of conversion. The DC of a conversion depends on how many conversion steps away from your faith an NPC is, starting at one conversion step for an NPC with no signif icant faith who matches your faith's alignment. For each step the NPC's alignment differs from the alignment of your faith, add one conversion step. If the NPC already holds a signif icant religious belief, add an additional conversion step. Note that servants of other faiths- including divine spellcasters who worship a deity and agents in the employ of a formal religion-normally can never be converted to a new faith. The GM has f inal discretion over whether an NPC will ever convert to your beliefs. If the GM rules that an NPC can be converted, the DC to convert that NPC is 10 + the NPC's Hit Dice + the NPC's Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) + 5 per conversion step. For example, a 5th level warrior with a Wisdom of 12 and no existing significant faith and who is the same alignment as your deity has a conversion DC of 21. Each conversion attempt requires at least an hour of proselytizing, and you can attempt no more than one conversion check per week. For your conversion attempt, roll a Diplomacy check and a Knowledge (religion) check at the DC determined above. If you succeed at both checks, decrease the number of conversion steps for that NPC by one. If you fail either check, you reinforce the NPC's existing faith and add one to the number of conversion steps for that NPC. If you fail three checks over the course of a conversion effort, the NPC rejects your faith and you cannot attempt another conversion for a year. However, if the number of conversion steps ever reaches 0, you convince the NPC to adopt your religion. Note that this does not necessarily change the NPC's alignment, so you could manage to convince a chaotic evil harpy to worship her own very odd form of Shelyn. While proselytizing is a reasonable activity for a religious adventurer, it should be handled with sensitivity, both in character and at the gaming table. Having a PC repeatedly attempt to convert NPCs who aren't interested is likely to result in worsening their attitude toward the character, and significant effort may be required to restore those relationships. Some players may be uncomfortable with too much time being spent on religious talk, in which case a GM is free to simply treat the conversion as a skill check, without actually roleplaying the talks that allow the conversion check to take place. Successful Conversion Characters that successfully convert others to their faith can gain divine blessings for adding new members to their religion. The first time at each character level a PC converts an NPC, they gain a conversion bonus for a number of days equal to the level of the NPC converted. Typical conversion bonuses for various faiths, and examples of classes likely to be interested in converting, are listed on the following page. In the case of Neutral deities, the bonus may be a sacred or profane bonus as most appropriate for the PC who gains it.

As a swift action while her shield is benefitting from Ragathiel's blessing (or as part of the action to activate the blessing), a Sixth Wing bulwark can direct her shield to protect an ally within 60 feet. The shield sprouts burning wings and flies to defend the ally, providing its shield bonus, damage reduction, and fire resistance to that ally instead of the Sixth Wing bulwark. Rounds in which she uses her shield in this manner count normally against the rounds per day in which she can use this ability. As long as she has rounds of sacred shield remaining, she can recall her shield to her arm as a swift action and regain its benefits.

The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way, but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way.

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 20th level, a bouda can change her form at will. If a bouda dies while in hyena shape, she does not revert back to her true form.

Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (if the spell's casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn't a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains.

The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma.

The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift , if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed-it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 12th level."

An herb witch can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy) checks, and she gains a bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to half her class level. Herb witches are adept at brewing thick herbal cure-alls called remedies. An herb witch prepares these remedies while communing with her familiar, during which she can prepare a number of remedies equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 remedy). A remedy becomes inert if it leaves the herb witch's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to her keeping. A witch can never have more remedies than 3 + her Intelligence modifier. As a standard action, the herb witch can administer a remedy to herself or a creature within reach which consumes the remedy. The herb witch attempts a Profession (herbalist) check against the save DC of any one disease or poison currently afflicting the consumer. If she is successful, the affliction is suppressed for 1 minute. At 10th level, if she exceeds the DC of the check by 10 or more, the affliction immediately ends. If the disease or poison doesn't allow saving throws, the remedy is ineffective. An herb witch can also use a remedy to attempt to remove the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and staggered conditions. This requires a Profession (herbalist) check with a DC equal to the spell or effect that caused the condition, or a DC 25 check if the condition was caused by an effect that doesn't allow a saving throw. If the herb witch succeeds, the condition is removed unless the condition is permanent; at 10th level, if the herb witch succeeds by 10 or more, her remedy can remove a permanent condition. Only a single condition, disease, or poison can be removed with each application of a remedy, and a creature can only benefit from one herbal remedy each day, whether or not the herb witch succeeds at her skill check.

        "patron mirror (su)": " At 1st level, a mirror witch creates a direct link to the power of her patron. She chooses a patron as normal, but instead of gaining a familiar that serves as the conduit to her patron, she uses a mirror (worth at least 10 gp) to speak to a fragment of her patron's power. This fragment teaches her magic and acts as a counselor. The mirror is essentially an immobile familiar. The mirror witch can activate it with a minute-long ritual that calls the patron fragment to manifest itself through the mirror. While this connection is open, she can prepare spells, add new spells to the mirror, and use the mirror's special abilities. In place of the boost granted by an ordinary familiar, the mirror grants the mirror witch a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks regardless of whether the mirror is nearby. The mirror can't be used for abilities that require the presence of a familiar, such as the blight hex. If the patron mirror is destroyed, the mirror witch can replace it 1 day later through a special ritual, attuning a new mirror to a different fragment of her patron. The mirror witch must purchase or procure a new, suitable mirror and spend 500 gp per witch level she has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete, and when it is finished, the mirror witch establishes a connection with a new fragment of her patron and loses access to spells stored in the previous mirror, as normal for a lost witch's familiar. As the mirror witch progresses in level, the mirror's defenses increase, and the connection between it and the mirror witch becomes stronger, allowing the patron to manifest more of its personality-see the Patron Mirror section below.

Cryptic Omens (Ex) : Each day, when a mirror witch consults with her patron mirror, the patron fragment can speak a few words of cryptic advice about the witch's future. While the words are often obscure when the fragment utters them, they nearly always make sense to the witch at just the right moment aid her in dealing with the threats of the day. Once per day, after the witch receives this advice, she can gain one of the following benefits without taking an action: gain a +2 insight bonus on a saving throw she is about to attempt; gain a +2 insight bonus on a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Sense Motive check she is about to attempt; or instead of rolling initiative, treat her initiative as if she rolled a 12 on the die. She can't use this last option if she can't act during a surprise round. She doesn't choose which benefit she gains while consulting the mirror; instead, she does so when she would be about to roll a saving throw, initiative check, or appropriate skill check. Seek Guidance (Ex) : Whenever the mirror witch consults with her patron fragment, she can spend 10 minutes instead of the usual 1 minute and attempt a single Knowledge check. She gains a +2 insight bonus on any Knowledge check she attempts during such a consultation. Greater Omens (Ex) : The number of times per day that the mirror witch can use cryptic omens increases by an amount equal to the Intelligence modifier of the patron mirror. Furthermore, after consulting with her patron for 1 minute, she can expend a use of cryptic omens to gain the effects of augury instead of one of the usual three benefits. Specialized Knowledge (Ex) The mirror witch chooses a number of Knowledge skills equal to the patron mirror's Intelligence modifier (and chooses more as the mirror's Intelligence modifier increases). When the witch consults her patron fragment with seek guidance for a Knowledge skill of one of the chosen types, the insight bonus increases by an amount equal to the mirror's Intelligence modifier. For example, at 5th and 6th levels, she gains a +4 insight bonus on a chosen Knowledge skill instead of the normal +2. Clairvoyance/Clairaudience (Sp) :  By consulting her patron fragment for 10 minutes, the mirror witch can expend a single use of cryptic omens to cast clairvoyance/clairaudience as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her witch level. Scrying (Sp) : By consulting with her patron fragment for 1 hour, the mirror witch can expend a single use of cryptic omens to use scrying as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her witch level, using the patron mirror as the focus. Mirror Casting (Su) : When using the mirror's scrying ability, detect chaos , detect evil , detect good , detect law , detect magic , message , read magic , and tongues all function reliably through the sensor. Also, if the mirror witch is at least 15th level, there is a 5% chance each of the following spells operates successfully through the sensor: cause fear , charm person , command , crushing despair , deep slumber , enthrall , fear , hold person , moonstruck APG , seek thoughts , and sleep ; a creature that succeeds at its saving throw against one of these linked spells is forever immune to that particular mirror witch's attempts to cast that spell on that creature through her mirror.",

When a pact witch chooses his plane, his body transforms in minor, cosmetic ways associated with that plane. A pact with Hell might give a pact witch small devil horns, while a pact with the Heaven might cause a pact witch to have a softly glowing golden halo, and a pact with Axis might give a pact witch's skin strange rune patterns.

This spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead empower its poison. An empowered poison's frequency increases by 50%. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to her new familiar as soon as she receives it. This replaces the hex gained at 1st level and the familiar's alertness special ability.",

Any creature that deals bleed damage to her with a natural, light, or one-handed weapon is automatically exposed to the same poison granted to her familiar and must succeed at the save or be affected by the poison. Additionally, when casting spells that have a single target and require a Fortitude save, she can cause the spell to deliver this poison as a free action; a target who succeeds at the save against the spell also avoids being affected by the poison. She can cause spells to deliver poison in this way a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This ability refreshes when the venom siphoner communes with her familiar to prepare her daily spells. This replaces the hex gained at 6th level."

In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.

Known as winter witches, these scions of Baba Yaga have not bothered to hide their secrets from outsiders, for they understand that those who see winter witches not native to Irrisen working their frozen magic will simply assume the witches are agents of Irrisen. By opening up their traditions to those who have no direct blood connection to Baba Yaga or the ruling families of Irrisen, they spread the notoriety and infamy of their wintry magic far beyond what they could accomplish on their own.

She can move across regular snow without penalty, and heavy snow costs her only 2 squares of movement instead of 4. Frozen Caress (Su) : Whenever the winter witch casts a touch spell, she can infuse the magic with cold as a swift action. This grants the spell the cold descriptor, and adds 1d4 points of cold damage to the spell's effect. If the touch spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates this additional cold damage."

Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier.

Safeguard : The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher's witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of +5 for either.

Instead, a wyrmwitch develops a metaphysical link with a bonded hoard of treasure that serves as a conduit to the wyrmwitch's patron. A wyrmwitch's hoard must have a value of 50 gp plus 100 gp for every character level he has beyond 1st. Only nonmagical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor, or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch's hoard. If the hoard falls below this value, the wyrmwitch cannot sleep on his hoard (see below) or add new spells to it until its value is restored. A wyrmwitch's spells come from this link with his hoard, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch's spells are normally granted by a familiar. A wyrmwitch can add spells to his hoard in a similar fashion to the way conventional witches store spells in their familiars. A witch's familiar and a wyrmwitch's hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also, a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard's spellbook, if the spellbook is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch's class spell list. The wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal to the spell's level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell. No matter the result, the spell is erased from the spellbook. A wyrmwitch must commune with his hoard to ready his body and mind for casting spells. If he does not spend at least 8 hours resting atop his hoard prior to preparing spells, he must attempt a concentration check anytime he attempts to cast a spell (DC = 20 + the spell's level). If the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wyrmwitch, including when determining casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wyrmwitch's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. This ability replaces witch's familiar."

These effects are visible; they take the appearance of armor, shields, or weapons as appropriate, and they always have some visual detail reminiscent of the wizard's bonded item (such as the pattern of a bonded ring appearing as decoration on a mage armor or shield effect). At 9th level, when the bonded wizard uses bonded force for mage armor , the armor bonus increases by 1; when she uses bonded force for shield , the shield bonus increases by 1; and she gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls when using bonded force for spiritual weapon .

This alternate version is identical to the chronomancer except he is a member of a random race, determined using the table that accompanies reincarnate . The alternate version has half the chronomancer's total hit points (but not any temporary hit points) and those spells the chronomancer had prepared when he died. The alternate version has the same equipment as the chronomancer but does not bear any artifacts the chronomancer was carrying. Any expendable items, charges, or expensive material components the alternate version uses are also expended for the chronomancer. This alternate version remains for 1 minute before the duplicate and its equipment are ripped back to their reality.

Most graduates of this college enter the service of the satrap as spies, scouts, or infiltrators.",

        "face in the crowd (sp)": " At 1st level as a standard action, you can cause yourself to appear so normal, mundane, and unexceptional that you blend in to your surroundings. All creatures within 30 feet treat you as if you belonged there, effectively ignoring you. Creatures outside of this area may notice that you appear out of place, but as soon as they approach within 30 feet they are affected by the magic and no longer think something is amiss. If you interact with an affected creature in any way, it gains a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) to disbelieve the illusion and notice you. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your wizard level, or until the illusion is dispelled. The minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect. This ability does not turn you invisible and opponents are not considered flat-footed. It does not allow you to disguise yourself as a specific individual, type of person, or member of another race, so you cannot blend into a group of uniformed guards or appear as a member of an individual's family, and a human cannot blend into a group of gnolls. You can blend in with any group made up of different types of people, such as a crowd of courtiers in a king's throne room, and you can disguise yourself (either through magic or more mundane means) to appear as a specific type of person or another race (such as a uniformed guard or a gnoll) before using this ability.",

        "source": "Adventurer's Guide pg. 58 Runesages draw upon the mystic energies of ancient Thassilon. While they sometimes experiment with the same heinous techniques exploited by the runelords, runesages temper their explorations into classic Thassilonian mysteries with moderation and empathy, maintaining balance by using small gemstones as the foci for their spellcasting. Runesages are experts at identifying spell effects associated with Thassilonian magic. As most of Thassilon's mysteries remain buried, runesages remain ever curious and continue to seek out new locations that hide secrets caches of Thassilonian magic.",
        "runic focus (su)": " A runesage can use her knowledge of runes to create a runic focus, a small, semiprecious stone engraved with Thassilonian runes that she manipulates to alter her spellcasting abilities. In function, a runic focus behaves like an ioun stone. To activate a runic focus, the runesage must meditate on it as she prepares her spells. Following spell preparation, she tosses the gemstone into the air, after which it orbits around her head. A runic focus remains in orbit until the next time the runesage prepares her spells. A runic focus automatically functions as a runesage's bonded object. A runesage does not have the option to specialize in an arcane school-all runesages must be universalists. However, when a runesage creates a runic focus, she must choose one Thassilonian school of magic (see page 63). When she prepares her spells, she is treated as a Thassilonian magic specialist of her runic focus's school for the purposes of determining what spells she can prepare (including gaining two additional spell slots per spell level of her school, and being unable to prepare spells from her runic focus's two opposition schools). She does not gain the corresponding powers of that school, however, and always functions as a universalist wizard in this regard. A runic focus allows the runesage to augment spells of a single arcane school to which the runic focus is aligned. As long as a runic focus remains activated, the runesage doesn't require material components for any spell she casts from the runic focus's aligned arcane school, provided the component's cost never exceeds 10 gp  x the runesage's caster level. If the spell requires a material component that surpasses the cost limit, the runesage must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal. A runic focus has an AC of 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5, as per an ioun stone. While the first runic focus a runesage creates is free, replacement runic foci can be created using the standard rules for replacing a bonded object for a wizard's arcane bond. When a runesage creates a new runic focus, she can focus it on a different school of Thassilonian magic than her previous focus as long as the new school is not one that was an oppositional school from her previous focus. For example, a runesage with a runic focus on necromancy could abandon that focus and replace it with a new focus on any school other than abjuration and enchantment (as these two schools are opposition schools to Thassilonian necromancy). This ability alters arcane bond and replaces arcane school."

In the hands of the wizard, the scroll acts as a short sword with an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 the level of the highest-level wizard spell on the scroll; a scroll with only a cantrip or 1st-level spell on it counts as a masterwork short sword. The scrollmaster is proficient in this weapon, and feats and abilities that affect short swords (such as Weapon Focus) apply to this weapon. A scrollmaster cannot wield two scrollblades at the same time. Activating this ability is a free action. A scroll blade only retains its abilities in the hands of the scrollmaster. The scroll blade has hardness 0 and hit points equal to the highest-level wizard spell on the scroll. Each successful hit by the scroll blade reduces its hit points by 1; this damage cannot be repaired, but does not affect casting from the scroll. When its hit points reach 0, the scroll is destroyed.

At 3rd level, when using a 4th-level or higher wizard scroll as a scroll blade, the scrollmaster can choose to reduce its enhancement bonus by 1 (minimum +1 enhancement bonus) to treat it as a reach weapon. For example, he could use a scroll of charm monster (a 4th-level wizard spell) as either a +2 short sword or a +1 short sword with reach.

Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9: Melee Weapon Special Abilities in the Core Rulebook ). The scrollmaster must know the prerequisite spell or spells to craft the weapon property in question (for example, he must know haste to be able to give his scroll blade the speed property).

Once per day, a spell sage can spontaneously cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or druid spell list as if it were a wizard spell he knew and had prepared. Casting the spell requires the spell sage to spend 1 full round per spell level of the desired spell (if the spell is on multiple spell lists indicated above, using the lowest level from among those lists) and requires expending two prepared spells of that spell level or higher; if the spell's casting time is normally 1 full round or longer, this is added to the spell sage's casting time. For example, if a spell sage wants to use spell study to cast cure light wounds (cleric spell level 1st), he must spend 2 full rounds casting and expend two prepared wizard spells of 1st level or higher.

In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a  x3 critical hit multiplier. A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun . When he casts through the arcane gun , the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.

An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements.

        "benefits": " A Thassilonian specialist wizard receives two additional spell slots of each spell level he can cast. These bonus spell slots must both be used to prepare the same spell from the wizard's school of specialization, allowing the wizard to cast that spell twice (as he has prepared the spell twice). The wizard cannot use these slots to prepare two different spells, even if they are of the school he is specialized in.",

These restrictions are more significant than those most wizards follow, and are known as prohibited schools. A Thassilonian wizard can never prepare a spell that is in one of his prohibited schools-he treats these spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list. If using a spell trigger or spell completion item to cast a spell from one of his prohibited schools, he must use the Use Magic Device skill to do so.",
        "thassilonian magic": " While the concept of wizard specializations along the classically recognized schools of magic certainly dates back to the time of Azlant, and perhaps beyond into the dim recesses of time before humanity rose to prominence, it was the runelords of Thassilon who explored school specialization to its full extreme. Focusing their research on the discovery that each school of magic was opposed by two specific opposition schools, the runelords developed methods of further enhancing their mastery over their chosen arcane specialties. Essentially, they defined these seven schools as much by what they couldn't do as by what they could. By excising 'impurities' introduced by fixed oppositional schools, they traded arcane versatility for greater strength in their chosen fields. The seven schools of Thassilonian Magic are presented here.",

This functions as the spell legend lore (caster level equal to the wind listener's level), except that the wind listener is free to engage in other activities while spirits investigate on his behalf. The time required for the air spirits to return with this information is equal to what the casting time of the spell legend lore would have been if the wind listener had cast it. The wind listener can use this ability once per week, and only if he does not currently have air spirits searching for information. If the air spirits are currently searching for information, the wind listener can end their task early as a standard action, dismissing the magical effect and not returning any information.

She automatically learns planar ally as a 6th-level wizard spell at 11th level, and greater planar ally as an 8th-level wizard spell at 15th level. She can swap out a prepared spell of an equal spell level to spontaneously cast any of these three spells (one 4th-level spell for lesser planar ally, a 6th-level spell for planar ally, and a 8th level spell for greater planar ally).

The crimson countess gains a morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made as part of a strike or counter equal to 1/2 her stored Vitae points. These bonuses increases by +2 when initiating such maneuvers against a Claimed creatures. In addition, she gains the following abilities as her Vitae pool grows: Drain (Su) : If the crimson countess has at least 1 Vitae point stored, she can deal damage equal to her class level to each creature she has Claimed as a move action.

While in her pool form, she gains a the following benefits and drawbacks: The crimson countess and other creatures can share a space freely. Neither the crimson countess nor these creatures gain any benefit or suffer ill effects from sharing the same space.   The crimson countess does not threaten spaces and cannot make attacks of opportunity.   The crimson countess cannot make melee or ranged attacks (and thus cannot initiate maneuvers that require them).   The crimson countess becomes immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

When she does, the mount immediately appears adjacent to the omen rider. The mount can be dismissed as a move action. A spectral steed has insubstantial hooves that make no sound and what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight and cannot attack, but other animals shun it and refuse to attack it. The spectral steed's AC is equal to the omen rider's, and it has a number of hit points equal to half her maximum hit points (minimum 10). In addition, it gains the benefits of any miss chances, immunities, and resistances the omen rider has. The spectral steed is not affected by effects that target an area, nor is it vulnerable to effects that do not deal hit point damage. The spectral steed always acts on the omen rider's initiative. If it loses all its hit points, the spectral steed disappears, but a new one may be summoned if the omen rider desires. A spectral steed has a base land speed of 40 feet at 1st level, which increases by 10 feet at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter (up to a maximum of 100 feet). It can bear its rider's weight and up to 50 pounds of other equipment, plus another 10 pounds per omen rider level. The spectral steed gains certain powers according to the omen rider's level.

Whenever an omen rider is mounted and uses a maneuver with a movement component (such as making a charge attack, or taking an extra move action), the omen rider can have her spectral steed make the appropriate move action in her place. Both the omen rider and spectral steed gain any benefits from the omen rider's maneuvers that would normally apply to the initiator (such as resistances, healing, temporary hit points, and the effects of counters).

Ghost touch weapons and effects that can affect incorporeal creatures normally ignore this miss chance. Starting at 10th level, the determination and tireless endurance of the spectral mount resonates and becomes shared to inhuman levels between the omen rider and itself.

Only one of the ravenlord or his dark messenger can initiate a strike in a single round (that is, if the dark messenger initiates a strike, the ravenlord may not initiate a strike until the next round, and vice versa). When either the ravenlord or his dark messenger initiates a strike, the other generates a 10-foot-radius sphere of Gloom for one round. The Gloom is stationary and grants concealment to the creature that generated it for as long as that creature is within its area.

For example, if the ravenlord is targeted with a charge attack, he can activate this ability to exchange places with his dark messenger. The dark messenger would then be the target of the charge attack.

The rosethorn princess can choose to not apply the damage bonus from accursed will to an attack if she wishes. This modifies accursed will.",
          "in the eye of the beholder": "At 1st level, the rosethorn princess gains Precise Shot as a bonus feat. She is also considered to have the Point- Blank Shot feat for the purposes of prerequisites but does not gain its benefits unless she actually possesses the feat. This replaces ill tidings.",
          "dark claim ": "The range at which a rosethorn princess may Claim a creature is always 60 feet + 5 feet per harbinger level if it would otherwise be shorter, including with feats such as Grasp of Darkness. The rosethorn princess loses the ability to make attacks of opportunity against a Claimed creature using the withdraw action to leave a square she threatens. This modifies dark claim.",
          "woodland stride ": "Starting at 2nd level, a rosethorn princess may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.",
          "kiss from a rose ": "A rosethorn princess imbues her desire for stagnancy into her ammunition as phantasmal seeds, which sprout from the wounds of her enemies into lush flowers and vines. Starting at 3rd level, she gains the ability to inflict a unique condition, bloom, onto her enemies. Bloom is a stacking condition that starts at bloom 1 and gets more severe with repeated applications: for example, a creature suffering from bloom 3 being inflicted with bloom 2 would then have the bloom 5 condition. However, bloom conditions inflicted by multiple rosethorn princesses on the same creature are tracked separately and do not stack with each other: apply only the effects of the highest severity. The rosethorn princess can inflict bloom in the following ways: Whenever she hits a creature with a ranged weapon attack and deals damage, she inflicts [bloom 1]; if it was the first successful attack from a strike maneuver that turn, she instead inflicts [bloom 2].   Enemies Claimed by the rosethorn princess are inflicted with [bloom 1] whenever they start their turn.   If a Claimed creature ends their turn without moving at least 5 feet, they gain [bloom 1]. Each creature can only gain bloom from a specific rosethorn princess once per round per above method. The bloom condition has the following effects: When a creature's bloom is at least 2, thin vines and flower buds wrap their limbs. They move at half speed (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment) and are cursed.   Starting at 5th level, the flowers on a creature with bloom 6 flourish, decorating them with a full bouquet of colors. The creature moves at one quarter speed (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment), is entangled, and can no longer take 5-foot steps.   Starting at 9th level, a creature at bloom 10 is on the verge of being consumed in a cloak of flowers, to the point their face or body can barely be recognized. The creature's speed is reduced to 5 feet, and they are also staggered, with the exception that they can still use a full-round action to tear blooms off themselves as below.   Starting at 15th level, creatures take a penalty to their highest ability score (before penalties) equal to half the amount of bloom they have. This cannot reduce the ability score to below 1.   A creature can tear all bloom off themselves or a willing ally within their reach. A standard action halves the total bloom on a creature, and a full-round action removes all bloom. Bloom deals 1d4 untyped damage to a creature for each stack of the condition removed from them in this way.   Otherwise, all bloom fades harmlessly after the affected creature has been outside of combat for more than one minute, or if the rosethorn princess dies. Bloom's speed reduction does not stack with any other speed reduction. However, if the rosethorn princess would ever reduce a creature's speed with the entangled condition via any of her other abilities (but not with items like  tanglefoot bags ), she may choose to have that ability inflict [bloom 3] instead of entangled. Bloom is a curse effect: a creature immune to curses is immune to bloom, and the successful use of  break enchantment ,  remove curse , or similar effects removes the bloom condition from the target in addition to their normal effects. If the rosethorn princess gains the w hispers of atrocity  feature at 19th level, her bloom also ignores all of a target's immunities. This replaces grim news and elusive shadow.",
          "in memoriam ": "Once the blooming flowers can fully capture a creature's beauty, the original is no longer needed, and should fade before they sully their legacy. At 4th level, when a creature suffering any bloom from the rosethorn princess dies, or otherwise falls unconscious from hit point loss or nonlethal damage, the cursed plants around them surge and grow into a giant blossom that fills the creature's space, even if the creature did not leave a corpse. If the creature is alive or still has a body, the blossom is linked to them. Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than half the rosethorn princess' character level do not create blossoms. A blossom hovers in position (it does not fall unless the rosethorn princess wants it to), and the linked creature or corpse cannot move or be moved from their space while the blossom exists - if they are teleported, the blossom teleports with them. Blossoms do not impede other creatures' movement or prevent the linked creature from being healed: a blossom fades if the linked creature is able to act again (this includes being recreated as an undead, or similar). Blossoms have one quarter of the rosethorn princess' maximum hit points, an armor class of 10 + her initiation modifier, and share the rosethorn princess' saving throw bonuses when relevant. The rosethorn princess can erase any of her blossoms in range of her Claim ability as a swift action. Otherwise, blossoms last for one minute before crumbling to dust. Once per round when within 5 ft. of a blossom, each ally of the rosethorn princess can use a free action to gain temporary hit points equal to the rosethorn princess' level that last for 1 round. When an enemy is within 5 ft. of a blossom, they are inflicted with [bloom 1], and always considered flanked against melee attacks, no matter where their attacker is. Each enemy can only gain bloom this way once per round. Creatures linked to a blossom can no longer gain additional bloom. This replaces massacre.",

          "drifting memories ": "Treasured recollections often shift over time, no longer reflecting what once was. At 8th level, once on each of her turns as a free action, the rosethorn princess can make one of her blossoms in range of her Claim ability move up to 15 feet. If the blossom is linked to a creature or corpse, the creature or corpse moves with it. No movement from this ability provokes attacks of opportunity. A blossom does not inflict bloom on adjacent enemies while moving, but it applies bloom as normal to adjacent enemies after it stops. This replaces ill intentions.",
          "mourning glory ": "At 10th level, enemies within 5-foot of a blossom are automatically sickened for as long as they remain in range of it.",
          "reminiscence ": "At 11th level, the rosethorn princess gains the ability to teleport to any free space adjacent to one of her blossoms in medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) as an immediate action once per encounter. This ability replaces black omen.",
          "harvest ": "At 16th level, the rosethorn princess can make attacks of opportunity through her blossoms, spending her own attacks of opportunity to let blossoms attack when a creature would provoke one from them. Her blossoms each threaten an area out to 10 ft. around them, use the attack bonus of the rosethorn princess (including her strength or dexterity modifier, accursed will, and the enhancement bonus of any one weapon she is wielding) and her combat maneuver defense, and on hit deal 4d8 magical piercing damage and inflict the entangled condition for 1 round. The rosethorn princess can make an additional number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to half her intelligence modifier.",
          "cherished moment ": "Starting 18th level, once per encounter as a move action, the rosethorn princess can draw on an idealized memory of a fallen enemy. She erases a blossom in range of her Claim ability, and in its space conjures a phantasmal copy of the creature that was linked to that blossom at full hit points, and with copies of all its equipment except artifacts. The copy is loyal to the rosethorn princess but has no true will of its own. The copy can immediately take a full turn of actions following directions from the rosethorn princess, and then disappears along with all its possessions when its turn ends. However, this copy can only use abilities or personal possessions that the rosethorn princess observed the original creature performing, and the original creature is immune to being directly affected by anything its copy does. This ability replaces voices in the dark. VARIANT: A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME [ ] The rosethorn princess is a ranged-attack harbinger archetype that is not centered on the Sagitta Stellaris discipline, but still has high mechanical synergy with it. While beauty of the night sky isn't an uncommon thing for a rosethorn princess to wish to emulate, players may still prefer to not have to reconcile such a distinct pair of thematics on a single character. Here are some official suggestions to adapt one to match the other: Sagitta Floris : The rosethorn princess has a unique way of expressing her Sagitta Stellaris maneuvers: trails are instead paths of floating petals or flowerbeds across the terrain, forced movement is caused by lashing vines, and other effects by magic glittering pollen. This should not be treated as a separate discipline in the campaign setting, merely a personal and perhaps heretical expression of Sagitta Stellaris - thus it is still based on Knowledge (geography), not Knowledge (nature). Princess of Penitence : The rosethorn princess is renamed to 'Princess of Penitence', and is themed around guilt, burdens, avoidance and gravity. The Bloom condition is renamed to Burden, and is represented by semi-corporeal chains that only the afflicted can feel the weight of, as they grow heavier and heavier. Blossoms become 'monuments', creating phantasmal altars or stakes to display the sins of the fallen creature. The princess of penitence loses Knowledge (Nature) as a class skill, but regains Knowledge (religion). Woodland Stride is replaced by  Weight On Your Shoulders (Ex) , which lets her treat her strength score as 4 higher for the purposes of carrying capacity. At 7th level, she gains  shackle  as an at-will spell-like ability instead of a  speak with plants  effect, but can only have a maximum number of restraints summoned at once equal to half her level: summoning another set above this limit causes the oldest existing set to disappear. She uses her initiation modifier as her spellcasting ability modifier for this spell-like ability. Other : Despite their appearance, the bloom and blossom mechanics do not create real plants, and do not interact specifically with abilities that affect plants, so a range of other minor reflavoring options is possible.",

In addition, she gains the following benefits: At 1st level, an aurora soul gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.   At 3rd level, an aurora soul gains  Greater Unarmed Strike  as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.   Starting at 7th level, an aurora soul adds her aurora soul initiation modifier as a bonus on damage rolls with unarmed strikes, and her unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the brokencondition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunsmoke mystic also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat, and can upgrade this gun to masterwork quality for 300gp and one day of work, as if she were a gunslinger.",
        "animus ammunition ": "At 1st level, a gunsmoke mystic learns how to form her animus into ammunition for a firearm. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the gunsmoke mystic can spend one point of animus per piece of ammunition created to reload an empty firearm on her person, filling the gun with with semi-real bullets or pellets and powder. These bullets or pellets are treated as mundane steel with no special abilities or properties, and after one of these bullets or pellets are used for an attack, it vanishes. However, due to the ephemeral nature of these pieces of ammunition, the gunsmoke mystic reduces the misfire value of the firearm by 1 (to a minimum of 1) while making attacks with her semi-real bullets. Firearms with multiple barrels or chambers (such as with a pepperbox or a revolver) must spend one animus per barrel or chamber being loaded (the gunsmoke mystic does not have to load a firearm to full capacity if she chooses). The gunsmoke mystic does not need to have a free hand to reload her firearms, she only needs to be touching the firearm to do so. If the firearm loaded with this ammunition has magical properties, these properties are bestowed upon the ammunition as normal.",
        "the way of the gun": "Gunsmoke mystics form a strong bond with their firearms, perfecting various methods of channeling animus through their shots. Animus Flush (Su) : Starting at 1st level, a gunsmoke mystic can use her animus to flush out her firearm after a misfire. As a move action, she can spend one point of animus to remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding. This ability can only repair a firearm that gained the broken condition as a result of a firearm misfire; if the gun was otherwise damaged, it does nothing   Gun-fu (Ex) : Starting at 2nd level, a gunsmoke mystic can use the butt or handle of her firearm as a light melee weapon (regardless of what sort of firearm it is). One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by a Small creature), and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by a Small creature). Regardless of the gunsmoke mystic's size, she threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. While wielding a firearm, the gunsmoke mystic threatens adjacent squares as normal for a melee weapon, and can use the butt or handle of her firearm to make attacks of opportunity. The gunsmoke mystic can attack with the gun in melee or fire it at range interchangeably, even within the same full-attack action (although she still provokes attacks of opportunity if she makes ranged attacks while threatened). In addition, if the firearm she wields has an enhancement bonus, that bonus applies to her melee attacks with the firearm.   Animus-Charged Bullets (Su) : Starting at 3rd level, a gunsmoke mystic may spend one point of animus as a free action to add her gunsmoke mystic initiation modifier to damage rolls with firearms for one round. The gunsmoke mystic can only use this ability once per round.   Focused Aim (Su) : Starting at 7th level, a gunsmoke mystic can take a move action to increase the accuracy of a firearm. After doing so, that firearm's range increment increases by 20 feet for her next attack with it. This ability stacks with all other bonuses to the firearm's range increment.   Ricochet Shot (Su) : Starting at 12th level, when initiating a ranged strike with a single target, the gunsmoke mystic may spend a number of points of animus equal to the level of that strike to target an additional enemy within 20 feet of the initial target. If she does so, she effectively initiates the strike twice, once against each target. The gunsmoke mystic can only use this ability once per round.   Martial Reloading (Su) : Starting at 17th level, whenever the gunsmoke mystic initiates a maneuver with her firearm, she may freely reload the shots used as part of that maneuver as if she had used the animus ammunition class feature, at no animus cost to her. This ability replaces bonus feats.",
        "flowing movements ": "Gunsmoke mystics know that true perfection comes from perfect practice. They train incessantly, mastering their movements to the point that they seemingly draw, fire, and reload their weapons on pure instinct. At 1st level, a gunsmoke mystic gains Rapid Reload as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites, and applies that feat to any firearm she wields. At 5th level, a gunsmoke mystic can reload a two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm, and a one-handed firearm as if it were a hand or light crossbow. At 9th level, a gunsmoke mystic no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when firing or reloading her firearm. This ability replaces withstand spell and quell magic."

        "soul candle ": "At 1st level, a knight-chandler creates a flickering ball of energy formed from a combination of arcane power and her own soulstuff, known as her candle. The knight-chandler's candle is a fist-sized mote of light that normally hovers in the knight-chandler's space, and has the following properties: The candle is not a creature or an object and is not subject to attacks of any kind.   The candle sheds bright light out to a distance of 5 feet per point of illumination the knight-chandler has in her illumination pool (see below), and normal light for an equal distance beyond that.   Once per round as a free action, the knight-chandler can will her candle to move up to her speed. The candle's movement is not inhibited in any way by difficult terrain or environmental conditions, although it cannot move through solid objects. The candle remains within one mile of its creator at all times; the knight-chandler may not move the candle beyond that radius, and if she attempts to move further than one mile from her candle, it floats along gently at the limit of its range. If the knight-chandler moves outside this range faster than the candle can follow (for example, by teleportation), the candle appears one round later in a random space precisely one mile from the knight-chandler.   If the candle is in the knight-chandler's space, she can instruct it to move with her; it moves when she does, remaining in her space until directed elsewhere. In addition, the knight-chandler may include her candle in teleportation effects that affect her. If she does so, it arrives in the same space she does.   As a swift action, the knight-chandler may summon her candle to her space from wherever it is.   Allies within 15 feet of the candle gain resistance to the knight-chandler's active element's associated energy type equal to the number of points in the knight-chandler's illumination pool, up to a maximum of the knight-chandler's class level plus her knight-chandler initiation modifier. Unlike other supernatural abilities, a knight-chandler's candle is not completely suppressed when it or the knight-chandler is within an antimagic field or similar effect. If the knight-chandler or her candle enters the area of such an effect, the candle immediately dims, shedding normal light with a radius of 5 feet, rather than its bright light. It loses all other abilities (including those gained through other class features) except for the knight-chandler's ability to direct it to move once per round as a free action. The candle regains its full power once both it and the knight-chandler remove themselves from the area of effect suppressing the ability.",
        "illumination ": "Unlike a normal mystic, a knight-chandler tempers her inner animus into an energy called illumination, fueling her candle and its effects. Outside combat, a knight-chandler has one point of illumination in her illumination pool; she may not gain additional points of illumination outside of combat. When a knight-chandler enters combat, she adds one point of illumination to her illumination pool at the start of her first turn, and one more point of illumination to her illumination pool at the start of each turn thereafter. In addition, a knight-chandler gains one point of illumination whenever she initiates a boost, and she can focus her power as a swift action to add two points of illumination to her pool. A knight-chandler's illumination pool persists for one minute after the last enemy combatant is defeated or the encounter otherwise ends, after which it drops back down to one point. In addition, the knight-chandler gains  Tap Animus  as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. Her levels in knight-chandler count as arcane spellcaster levels for the purposes of qualifying for prerequisites (such as those of item creation feats or the Arcane Strike feat), and if a knight-chandler ever develops arcane spellcasting from another class, she may add her knight-chandler level to her levels in that class to determine her overall caster level for the purposes of item creation feats. A knight-chandler's inner illumination manifests in both her candle and a powerful enhancement of her body and soul: Starting at 1st level, a knight-chandler can empower her attacks with a brilliant luminescence. Whenever the knight-chandler hits a creature with an attack, she can choose to have her target become outlined as if by a  faerie fire  spell, with a caster level equal to the knight-chandler's initiator level. Successive uses of this ability against the same creature do not stack; instead, they extend the duration.    Starting at 4th level, a knight-chandler deals additional damage equal to her initiator level on any attack she makes as part of a strike against an opponent that threatens one of her allies other than herself.   Starting at 9th level, when a knight-chandler hits a creature outlined by her illumination with an attack, she can choose to snuff out the light affecting that creature to heal herself for a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the damage dealt by her attack. Activating this ability is a free action that can be taken even if it isn't the knight-chandler's turn, although it can only be used once per round. The knight-chandler cannot heal more damage than her target's maximum hit points with this ability.   Starting at 17th level, the knight-chandler can perceive the surroundings of her candle as if she herself were there. She can treat the candle's space as her own for the purposes of determining line of sight, making Perception checks, or the range of any special senses she possesses (such as blindsense). In addition, once per encounter, the knight-chandler can teleport to her candle as a standard action. The knight-chandler does not require line of effect to use this ability, although if her candle's space is occupied by another creature, she is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. This is a teleportation effect. This ability replaces animus.",
        "candle magic ": "The bright energy that the knight-chandler's candle releases is more than mere light; it is her raw power, infused with her loyalty and devotion. As her illumination builds, the knight-chandler can shape this energy into various effects. At 3rd level, the knight-chandler can project a votive effect from her candle. At 8th level, she can also project a lantern effect from her candle. Finally, at 15th level, the knight-chandler can also project a bonfire effect from her candle. The knight-chandler may change which effects her candle projects as a swift action, though she can never project more than one effect of the same type at a time. All allies within 15 feet of the knight-chandler's candle gain the benefits of the projected effect. Votive Effects: [ ] Affected allies gain a morale bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting abilities equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, up to a maximum bonus equal to her knight-chandler initiation modifier.   Affected allies add energy damage of the knight-chandler's active element's associated energy type equal to the knight-chandler's illumination to their melee and ranged attacks, up to a maximum amount equal to her class level.   Affected allies gain the ability to move 5 feet as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity.   Affected allies gain the ability to tap into the candle's energy as a swift action, gaining temporary hit points equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to her class level. These temporary hit points do not stack with themselves, and last for up to 1 minute. Lantern Effects : [ ] Affected allies gain the ability to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to the knight-chandler as a move action. If there is no such space available, the ally does not spend their move action and does not teleport, instead getting a sense of being impeded. The knight-chandler cannot benefit from this effect when it is projected from her own candle.   Affected allies gain immunity to death effects, and gain a bonus on saving throws against psi-like abilities, psionic powers, spell-like abilities, spells, and supernatural abilities of undead creatures equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, to a maximum bonus equal to the knight-chandler's initiation modifier.   Affected allies gain a bonus on caster level checks, manifester level checks, and skill checks equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, up to a maximum bonus equal to her knight-chandler initiation modifier.   Affected allies gain a deflection bonus to their AC equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, to a maximum bonus equal to her knight-chandler initiation modifier. Bonfire Effects : [ ] Affected allies gain fast healing equal to the knight-chandler's illumination, to a maximum amount equal to her class level.   Whenever an affected ally recovers one or more maneuvers, that ally heals up to 2 points of ability damage to a single ability score of their choice. If an ally does not have maneuvers or does not wish to recover maneuvers, they can activate this ability as a standard action.   Affected allies gain the ability to move up to twice their speed as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity.   If an affected ally would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, that ally can trigger the candle's power as an immediate action. If they do, that ally is immediately restored to 1/2 their maximum hit point total, and all of the following adverse conditions affecting that ally (if any) immediately end: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. The damage that would have reduced the ally to 0 or fewer hit points is negated. Triggering the candle's power in this fashion is draining to the knight-chandler; doing so reduces the knight-chandler's illumination pool to one point (even if her minimum is normally higher) and renders her incapable of projecting bonfire effects for the remainder of the encounter. This ability replaces elemental glyphs.",

As a swift action, she can select an ally within 15 feet. That ally chooses a single boost or counter that the knight-chandler has readied and unexpended. Until the beginning of the knight-chandler's next turn, that ally can initiate that maneuver as if they had readied it normally, using the knight-chandler's initiator level or their own, whichever is higher. If the ally chooses to initiate the maneuver, the knight-chandler expends that boost or counter (even if it isn't currently granted to her; if it wasn't granted to her, treat it as though it had been granted, then expended). This ability replaces quell magic.",

Her type changes to Outsider, and she gains the Native and Good subtypes. In addition, she ceases aging, and her minimum illumination becomes equal to her knight-chandler initiation modifier; increasing as normal during combat and resetting to her new minimum after spending one minute outside combat. Finally, the knight-chandler gains the ability to initiate two boosts with the same swift action, expending each as normal. This ability replaces glyph mastery.",

Such characters may not advance further as knight-chandlers until such a time as they cease being of evil alignment, though they do not lose access to their class features. Even an evil knight-chandler remembers her former loyalty and compassion, and by focusing on these memories, she can still summon a candle and use her candle magic."

A bushi gains bushidos from the following list: Benevolence : The bushi's kindness and concern for his allies takes on a supernatural quality. The bushi can spend a swift action to grant all allies within 30 feet a number of temporary hit points equal to the bushi's initiator level. These temporary hit points do not stack with other temporary hit points, and last for one minute or until depleted. Courage : The bushi becomes immune to nonmagical fear effects. In addition, he gains a +4 bonus on saves against fear effects, and can grant this bonus to his allies within 60 feet for a number of rounds equal to his bushi initiation modifier as a swift action. Honesty : The Universal Truth speaks to the bushi, allowing him to detect falsehood wherever it may hide. The bushi can use  discern lies  as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his initiator level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his initiation modifier, although these rounds need not be consecutive. Honor : The bushi knows that honorable combat is the only true test of a warrior, and that the most honorable combat is a one-on-one duel. Whenever the bushi hits a creature with an attack, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature until the end of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 for every four initiator levels the bushi possesses. A bushi does not get an additional benefit from attacking a creature multiple times, although he loses the bonus if he does not attack the creature for one round. Loyalty : The bushi's strong sense of loyalty to friends and allies allows him to instinctively know when they are in danger. As a standard action, the bushi can mark an ally, allowing him to know the relative position and general condition of the marked allies as if they were under the effects of both a  deathwatch  and a  status  spell. This mark lasts for a number of hours equal to the bushi's initiator level, and functions as long as both the bushi and the target are on the same plane. The bushi can activate this ability a number of times per day equal to his bushi initiation modifier (minimum 1). Respect : The bushi respects all life, and knows that the strength of his allies support his own strength. Whenever the bushi uses the aid another action, he uses his bushi initiation modifier (minimum +2) instead the normal aid another bonus granted to his allies. Righteousness : The bushi knows right from wrong on an inherent, instinctual level.

Unless otherwise specified, each ploy can only be taken once. A warlord privateer may choose to take a ploy in place of a warlord bonus feat or gambit. A stalker privateer may choose to take a ploy in place of a stalker art. This ability does not cause the privateer class template to be incompatible with other archetypes that alter the warlord's bonus feats or gambit class features, or the stalker's stalker arts class feature. Daring Gambit : The privateer learns one warlord gambit (see the warlord class feature), using his privateer initiation modifier instead of his Charisma modifier for any relevant bonuses. In addition, whenever the privateer succeeds on a gambit, he and each other ally within 30 feet recover one expended maneuver. This ploy can be taken multiple times; each additional time it is taken, the privateer learns one new gambit.      Dazzling Gambit : Whenever the privateer succeeds on a gambit, he can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all opponents within 30 feet as a free action, even if it isn't his turn.      Deadly Strike : The privateer gains the deadly strike class feature (see the stalker class feature) as a stalker of his level  -4 (minimum 1d6 damage). The privateer uses his privateer initiation modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the duration of his deadly strikes. If the privateer already has the deadly strike class feature, this ploy instead increases the damage of his deadly strikes by 1d6.      Gun Training : The privateer gains Amatuer Gunslinger as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. He uses his privateer initiation modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the maximum amount of grit points he can have. In addition, the privateer gains a grit feat of his choice as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat as normal. If the privateer already has grit from another ability, he gains Extra Grit as a bonus feat instead of Amatuer Gunslinger, as normal (he can use his privateer initiation modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier if he so wishes).      Laugh It Off : Once per day when the privateer fails a Fortitude or Will save, he can reroll that saving throw as a free action, even if it isn't his turn. He must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. At 10th level and again at 15th level, the privateer can use this ability one additional time per day.      Red Shirt, Brown Pants : Once per encounter when the privateer takes damage, he can grant his other allies within 60 feet gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to his privateer initiation modifier for 1d6 rounds as a free action, even if it isn't his turn.      Salt in the Wound:  The privateer gains Improved Dirty Trick and Greater Dirty Trick as bonus feats, even if he does not meet their prerequisites.      Sea Legs : The privateer gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause him to become sickened, nauseated, fatigued, or exhausted. At 5th level and again at every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1.      Sea Combat : The privateer can treat ranged attacks with firearms against adjacent opponents as melee attacks in every way. He may initiate strikes and use feats and abilities that normally only apply to melee attacks (such as Power Attack) with such attacks, and uses his Strength modifier to determine his attack bonus instead of his Dexterity modifier. He adds his Strength modifier to damage rolls as normal for a melee weapon of the firearm's handedness. The privateer may treat one-handed firearms as light weapons for the purpose of the Weapon Finesse feat, the penalties for fighting with two weapons, and similar effects. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making attacks in this manner, and may not use feats that normally only apply to ranged weapons while treating a firearm as a melee weapon. In addition, the privateer can reload a one-handed firearm while wielding another weapon in his other hand, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity while doing so.      Sneak Shot : Once per round when the privateer makes a full attack using a melee weapon, he can draw and fire a loaded one-handed firearm as a free action. The attack with the firearm must be made against one of the targets of the privateer's full attack, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity.      Terrifying Brutality : Whenever the privateer reduces an opponent to 0 hit points, he can terrify another opponent within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the privateer's class level + the privateer's initiation modifier) or cower for one round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.      Terrifying Strike : Whenever the privateer successfully hits an opponent with a deadly strike, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the privateer's class level + the privateer's initiation modifier) or become shaken for one round. If the target is already shaken or demoralized, they instead become frightened for one round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."

In order for a soul hunter to recover maneuvers, he must either focus on the hunt of his prey or on the memories of past kills as a standard action and recover one expended maneuver. Alternately, the soul hunter may tap into the escaping energy of a soul by using his Soul Claiming ability (see Soul Claiming class feature below), and recover a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Wisdom modifier.",
        "ki pool": "A soul hunter is more in-tune with his own native rhythms so he may better hunt his chosen prey. The soul hunter stalker's base  ki  pool is increased by 2 additional points of  ki  at first level. Additionally, the use of his  ki  pool affords him several other abilities. At 5th level, the soul hunter may use his soulburning on Claimed targets within 30 ft. of his position. The stalker spends 1 point of  ki  as a move action and all Claimed targets suffer his soulburning damage. At 7th level, the stalker may spend 1 point from his  ki  pool to gain a +4 insight bonus on a saving throw as an immediate action. At 9th level, the stalker can delve into his subconscious in battle and remember key lessons from his training. The stalker envisions potential scenarios where martial abilities he has not readied come into play and gains a momentary burst of martial insight. A number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the character spends one  ki  point as a swift action to trade an unexpended readied maneuver for a maneuver known of the same level or lower and have it immediately readied and accessible for his use. The character may initiate this maneuver and recover it as if he had prepared at the beginning of the day (or whenever the stalker readied his maneuvers last).

As a swift action, the soul hunter stalker may Claim a target creature that he has inflicted damage upon. A Claimed target's position is known to the soul hunter, even if they have total concealment against him (though he still suffers the normal miss chance if his target is concealed, and is denied his Dexterity bonus if the Claimed target attacks him). Additionally, the target of his Claiming provokes attacks of opportunity from the soul hunter when using the withdraw action to escape him. A soul hunter may not Claim more than his Wisdom modifier in creatures at any given time; a creature remains Claimed until the soul hunter withdraws his Claim (a free action) or until the target is slain. If the Claimed target is slain (reduced to 0 or fewer hit points) by the Claiming soul hunter, then he may recover his Wisdom modifier in expended maneuvers. A soul hunter may not Claim a target creature with fewer than 1/2 HD. This replaces the stalker's standard recovery method.",
        "soulburning ": "When combating his target, the soul hunter can use his ki to cause disharmony within a Claimed creature's very life energy, causing the foe's own ki to erupt into life-destroying energy. Some describe the pain experienced as being the worst that any could endure, like something was inside their very spirit and devouring it whole. When making an attack or initiating a martial maneuver against his Claimed target, the soul hunter may force this subtle disharmony to become a geyser of agony, as the soul hunter's ki causes the target's life energies to ignite. This inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage at 1st level upon a successful attack, and this damage increases by an additional 1d6 points of damage every four soul hunter levels. Stalker arts that utilize deadly strikes use soulburning instead, and function as written with the following caveat: Soulburning cannot be done against targets that do not have vital forces (this includes constructs, oozes, and undead with an Intelligence score of 0.) This replaces the stalker's deadly strikes ability.",
        "combat insight ": "The soul hunter's combat insight differs from a more traditionally trained stalker in the following ways: At 2nd level, the soul hunter gains the scent special ability, and gains a +4 insight bonus to track targets that the he has Claimed. At 12th level, whenever he reduces a Claimed target to 0 hit points or less, he may recover an expended maneuver. These replace the abilities gained through combat insight at 2nd and 12th level.",
        "sight of the hunter (sp)": "The soul hunter learns ways to be able to hunt his prey with his extrasensory abilities. At 6th level, the soul hunter may spend 1  ki  and use the spell  clairaudience  - clairvoyance  (clairvoyance only) as a spell-like ability, using his stalker level as his caster level for the effect. He may spend an additional  ki  point to Claim a target seen in such a way. At 16th level, he may spend a  ki  point to use  scrying  and  locate creature  as spell-like abilities, and Claim targets spied upon in such a manner. The soul hunter must have either visited the location first, or have a clear picture of the target within his mind to use these abilities (as per the spells specific requirements).

A vigilante's inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night's sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. A vigilante can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The vigilante can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Perception, or Sense Motive skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he's trained in the skill. Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, although it costs two points of inspiration rather than one. Using inspiration while making a saving throw is an immediate action, rather than a free action. This ability replaces ki pool.",

This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every three vigilante levels thereafter (2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and so on). Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a vigilante can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack not even with the usual  -4 penalty.

She gains Intimidate and Spellcraft as class skills. She otherwise learns, readies, and initiates maneuvers as a standard warder. In addition, the fiendbound marauder's fiend's grip is considered a discipline weapon for the Black Seraph and Cursed Razor disciplines. This ability alters maneuvers.",
        "fiend's grip ": "The signature feature of fiendbound marauders is the ability to manifest an oversized, spiny spectral claw, often wrapped in barbed chains. To manifest her fiend's grip, a warder must be wearing gauntlets or spiked gauntlets, which act as a focus for the weapon to come into the world. The warder can manifest up to one fiend's grip for each gauntleted hand she has. Manifesting a fiend's grip is a move action, and dismissing one is a free action. A fiend's grip is a light weapon that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning or slashing damage (for a Medium-sized wielder). It threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. A fiend's grip has the grapple and reach weapon properties, and the fiendbound marauder gains the grab universal monster ability for attacks made with her fiend's grip. Unlike a normal reach weapon, the fiendbound marauder can be used against adjacent foes. In addition, the fiendbound marauder can apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls with her fiend's grip, even if wielding it in her off hand. A fiend's grip is treated as a spiked gauntlet for the purposes of Weapon Focus, being discipline weapon for a discipline, or other feats and abilities. A fiendbound marauder is always proficient in her fiend's grip. A fiend's grip is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. It is also considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, affecting incorporeal creatures, and similar effects. When attacking with her fiend's grip, the fiendbound marauder may apply any magical properties and enhancement bonus of the gauntlet or spiked gauntlet that fiend's grip used as a focus to her attacks. She can also treat a fiend's grip as being made of the special material of the gauntlet or spiked gauntlet used as a focus. For example, a fiendbound marauder wearing a  +1 flaming gauntlet  and a  +2 adamantine defending   gauntlet  would grow a  +1 flaming fiend's grip  and a  +2   adamantine defending fiend's grip . As a supernatural ability, manifesting a fiend's grip does not provoke attacks of opportunities. A fiend's grip cannot be counterspelled or dispelled, although it winks out while within an  antimagic field  or similar effect. If a fiend's grip is sundered or disarmed, the spectral weapon disappears, and may be manifested again on the fiendbound marauder's next turn (although if the gauntlet it was using as a focus is sundered or otherwise removed, the fiend's grip cannot be recalled until the fiendbound marauder has a new gauntlet). This ability replaces aegis and clad in steel.",

In addition, the fiend's grip can be manifested as a free action, rather than a move action. At 11th level, the fiendbound marauder's fiend's grip's critical multiplier increases to x3. This ability replaces extended defense at 5th and 11th levels.",
        "fiendish empowerment ": "At 8th level, the fiendbound marauder's fiend's grip infects his armor, causing it to grow cruel spikes and blades when her weapon manifests. While her fiend's grip is manifested, the fiendbound marauder's armor grows  +1 ghost touch   armor spikes  that deal piercing and slashing damage. If the armor already had spikes, they grow crueler, dealing damage as if the fiendbound marauder was one size category larger, dealing piercing and slashing damage, and using the enhancement bonus granted by this ability or their original enhancement bonus, whichever is higher, and gaining the benefits of the  ghost touch  weapon special ability. In addition, the fiendbound marauder gains resistance 10 to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. At 14th level, the enhancement bonus of these armor spikes increases to +2, and the fiendbound marauder gains resistance 10 to a third energy type from the above list. At 17th level, the enhancement bonus of these armor spikes increases to +3, and the energy resistances granted by this ability increase to 20. If the fiendbound marauder is not wearing armor, she can still manifest her armor spikes and gain the energy resistances granted by this ability while wielding a fiend's grip if she so chooses.

At the GM's options, other animals may be suitable mounts for a hussar to select. A hussar's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. A hussar does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.

Whenever a hussar is mounted and uses a maneuver with a movement component (such as making a charge attack, or taking an extra move action), the hussar can have his mount take the appropriate movement in his place. If the maneuver allows the hussar to make a charge attack, both him and his mount are considered to be charging. This replaces the share spells ability that normal animal companions gain.",

Adopting a formation is a move action for the hussar, and allies within range of someone in the formation can enter the formation as a free action. Formations have a limited range, as noted in the formation's description. In order for a hussar's ally to participate in a formation and gain its benefits, they must start their turn within range of another ally who is participating in the formation. Allies participating in a formation do not necessarily have to be within range of the hussar; they merely must be within range of another ally within the formation. A hussar may only have one formation active at a time, and if the hussar leaves a formation, all allies in the formation also leave that formation. A creature can only gain the benefits of one formation at any given time. The hussar selects one formation from the following list to learn at 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, and 17th levels: Guerrilla:  Allies in the Guerrilla formation gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures they flank. At 7th level, allies in the formation can take a 5-foot step once per round as a free action (even if it isn't their turn) as long as that 5-foot step would place them in a position to flank an opponent. At 15th level, as long as two allies in the formation are adjacent to the same opponent, they are considered to be flanking that opponent.  Range: 15 feet.      Marching:  Allies in the Marching formation gain a +10- foot bonus to their movement speeds. At 7th level, allies in the formation gain the benefits of the Endurance and Diehard feats. At 15th level, allies in the formation cannot become fatigued or exhausted for as long as they remain in this formation. If an ally is already fatigued or exhausted when they join the formation, they ignore the effects of the condition while they remain in the formation.  Range: 10 feet.      Phalanx:  Allies in the Phalanx formation gain a +1 bonus to their AC and to Reflex Saves. At 10th level, these bonuses increase to +2, and allies in the formation gain evasion (as the rogue class feature). At 15th level, this bonus to AC increases to +2 for each ally in the formation (up to a maximum of +10) and the bonus to Reflex saves increases to +1 for each ally in the formation (up to a maximum of +5).  Range: 5 feet.      Siegebreaker:  Allies in the Siegebreaker formation gain a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks when making bull rush, disarm, and sunder attempts. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +8. At 15th level, allies in the formation ignore an amount of hardness an object has equal to 5 times the number of allies in the formation, and can perform disarm and sunder combat maneuvers on opponents as if they were two size categories larger. This stacks with other effects that increase effective size.  Range: 15 feet.      Surge:  Allies in the Surge formation gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls while charging. At 10th level, whenever an ally in the formation charges a creature, they may make one turn of up to 90 degrees when charging. At 15th level, whenever an ally in the formation makes a charge attack, one other ally in the formation can make a charge attack against the same target as an immediate action. The ally making this charge attack must be able to charge the target in order to activate this ability, and cannot make a charge on their following turn afterwards. Only one ally in the formation can use this ability per round, regardless of how many allies are in the formation.  Range: 10 feet.      Terror:  Allies in the Terror formation gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize opponents. At 7th level, allies in the formation gain the benefits of the Dazzling Display feat, except that they may use it with any weapon they wield, not just ones with which they have Weapon Focus. At 15th level, whenever an ally in the formation successfully demoralizes an opponent, that opponent takes an additional  -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for as long as it is shaken.  Range: 10 feet.      Volley:  Allies in the Volley formation gain a +2 bonus on ranged attack rolls. At 10th level, ranged attacks made by these allies ignore all concealment less than total concealment. At 15th level, allies in the formation gain the ability to launch a hail of deadly bolts or arrows that affects a 5-foot-radius burst within their weapon's first range increment as a standard action. This attack deals 1d6 points of damage per character level of the ally to any creature in the area. Creatures in the area may make a Reflex Save (DC 10 + 1/2 that ally's Hit Dice + that ally's Dexterity modifier) to halve this damage. Damage reduction applies as normal to this damage, although it is treated as if it had been dealt by the ally's weapon for the purposes of overcoming it.  Range: 5 feet."

Enemies of the bannerman within 30-ft. of his position are filled with dread as if under a  fear  spell (use the bannerman's Charisma modifier for the Will save DC and his initiator level as his caster level). Foes that succeed the saving throw are unaffected by the bannerman's fearsome presence for 24 hours.

When he lends this maneuver, the maneuver is expended until the recipient initiates this maneuver (using the recipient's initiator level and Charisma modifier to determine the saving throw DC; if the recipient's initiator level is too low to initiate the maneuver, then the bannerman cannot lend the maneuver).

Some official ideas for how a bannerman may carry a banner: as heraldry on a shield, on a small pole mounted to either his mount's saddle or to the back of his armor, a tabard that they wear prominently, or a standard that hangs from a polearm or spear. So long as that standard is carried upon his person where people can see it, he can inspire these allies.      Share Boost (Ex) [ ]   At 6th level, the bannerman's ability to inspire his troops allows him to share some of his martial prowess with an ally on occasion. Once per day he is able to initiate a boost as an immediate action to utilize a boost for an ally who is initiating a maneuver or making an attack that qualifies for the use of that boost.

If the Golden Lion stance he is using grants a similarly typed bonus to attack, damage, or saving throws, then increase that bonus by the amount of the inspiring banner's bonus. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the bannerman or his mount to function, and can be held while using a buckler. This replaces the warlord's battle prowess class feature. The Bannerman and his Banner  While trying to leave it to the player and GM to determine if a banner is acceptable for the character in the method of how it is carried, we wanted to be more easy and unrestricted with it. A bannerman's banner is intended to be able to be placed on any manner of item so long as it is displayed. Some official ideas for how a bannerman may carry a banner: as heraldry on a shield, on a small pole mounted to either his mount's saddle or to the back of his armor, a tabard that they wear prominently, or a standard that hangs from a polearm or spear. So long as that standard is carried upon his person where people can see it, he can inspire these allies.",
        "share boost ": "At 6th level, the bannerman's ability to inspire his troops allows him to share some of his martial prowess with an ally on occasion. Once per day he is able to initiate a boost as an immediate action to utilize a boost for an ally who is initiating a maneuver or making an attack that qualifies for the use of that boost. The boost shared uses the bannerman's initiator level and saving throw DC (if applicable). He can use this ability one additional time per day at 12th level and again at 18th level. This replaces the dual boost class feature."

All other creatures treat his gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The desperado also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat, and can upgrade this gun to masterwork quality for 300gp and one day of work, as if he were a gunslinger. In addition, he gains Amatuer Gunslinger as a bonus feat. He uses his desperado initiation modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the maximum amount of grit points he can have. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.",
        "fan the hammer ": "A desperado's hands are lightning-quick, and he seemingly seemingly draws, fires, and reloads his weapons on pure instinct. At 2nd level, a desperado gains Rapid Reload as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites, and applies that feat to any firearm he wields. At 5th level, a desperado can reload a two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm, and a one-handed firearm as if it were a hand or light crossbow. At 9th level, a desperado no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when firing or reloading his firearm. This replaces tactical presence (indomitable presence).",
        "daring grit ": "Through determination, verve, or otherwise dumb luck, a desperado is capable of forcing incredible feats of daring and skill through their own tenacity. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a desperado's ability to perform incredible actions in combat. Starting at 5th level, at the start of each day, a desperado gains a number of grit points equal to his desperado initiation modifier (minimum 1). His grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than his desperado initiation modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A desperado spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways: Critical Hit with a Firearm:  Each time the desperado confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, he regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the desperado's character level does not restore grit. Killing Blow with a Firearm:  When the desperado reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, he regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the desperado's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit. When the desperado gains this ability, his Amateur Gunslinger feat is immediately traded for the Extra Grit feat, as normal. If the desperado already has gunslinger levels, he gains a bonus to the maximum amount of grit he can have each day equal to his desperado initiation modifier, but gains no extra grit at the start of each day. This ability replaces the remaining tactical presences gained at 5th and 9th levels. Daring Acts   With the GM's approval, a desperado can regain grit by performing daring acts. As a general rule, a daring act should be risky and dramatic. It should take a good deal of guts, and its outcome should have a low probability of success. If it is successful, the desperado regains 1 grit point. Before attempting a daring act, the player should ask the GM whether the act qualifies. Th GM is the final arbiter of what's considered a daring act, and can grant a regained grit point for a daring act even if the player does not ask beforehand whether the act qualifies.",

Some deeds stay in effect as long as the desperado has at least 1 grit point. For the purposes of learning and performing deeds and for prerequisites, a desperado's effective gunslinger level is equal to his class level  -4. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed. At 5th level and again at 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th levels, the desperado learns a deed that a gunslinger of his effective gunslinger level could learn. He may select deeds from both the standard gunslinger's list and those normally only available to specific gunslinger archetypes.
