All formulae have a base crafting DC as noted in their descriptor, and their saving throw DCs, if any, are determined using the normal formula for combat sphere talents, using the practitioners ranks in Craft (alchemy) in place of their base attack bonus. The necessary ingredients for creating formulae are gathered over the course of a given day; there is no monetary cost to creating a formulae. You may craft any item whose formulae you know in 30 minutes, or 15 minutes if you have access to an alchemists lab or alchemists crafting kit, but due to the volatile nature of the enhanced formulae you cannot have more formulae prepared at one time than a number equal to 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy) (minimum 1) + the number of formulae talents you possess. For every 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, you may craft 1 additional formulae as part of the same 30/15 minute time period. Any creature affected by splash damage from an improved formulae is entitled to a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. Because formulae are more unstable than standard alchemical items, they expire and no longer work after 24 hours; it is relatively easy (DC 10 Appraise) to recognize the unstable and impermanent nature of these items so typically they have no monetary value; a potential buyer who fails their Appraise check assumes they are a standard item of their type (if applicable), or as a mundane item worth no more than 10 gp. In addition, the overly refined and unstable nature of formulae means that they cannot be further refined or enhanced by items such as focusing flasks or hybridization funnels. You cannot fail to craft an alchemical item you know the formulae for; failure to meet the DC instead means you create the item but at its minimum potency, without additional effects or benefits for having additional Craft (alchemy) ranks or having increased the crafting DC. When you first gain this package, you may learn any one (formulae) talent you qualify for. Clarification: Additional damage dice in formulae for having multiple ranks in Craft (alchemy) are always treated as bonus damage dice and are not multiplied by Vital Strike or a critical hit.

This poison may be contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury (chosen when created), but you cannot increase its DC by using multiple doses. Some (toxin) talents have additional effects when a creature fails multiple saving throws against a poison; these toxins can affect a creature who has already failed a saving throw against their effects if the target is exposed to additional applications of the same toxin on subsequent rounds, requiring an additional saving throw, though a single target cannot be affected by the same (toxin) more than once per round. The necessary ingredients for creating poison are contained within an alchemy crafting kit or alchemists lab and are otherwise gathered over the course of a given day; there is no monetary cost to creating a poison. You may apply this poison to a weapon as part of the same standard or move action used to create it and do not risk poisoning yourself when doing so. After creating a poison, you may make a melee touch attack against a target (if using a contact poison) or throw the poison (if using an inhaled poison) as a standard action. Thrown poisons have a 10 foot range increment. A poison remains potent until used or for 1 round +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, whichever comes first.

            "benefit": "If you have a secured rope, a set piton, thrown a grappling hook, or wrapped a whip or similar weapon around a point, you may use the attached rope or weapon to spring around the battlefield. There are five methods for securing a rope: Flail Group Weapon: Weapons from the flails weapon group may be used as if they were a grappling hook, though applying them requires a melee attack roll rather than a ranged attack roll. A length of rope may be used in this way also, taking improvised weapon penalties as appropriate. Grappling Hook: You may throw a held grappling hook as a swift action, making a grapple check against a creature or a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. This deals no damage. You may use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on this grapple check. A creature may remove a grappling hook as a move action with a Strength or Escape Artist check against this spheres DC or a grapple check against your grapple CMD. The range increment of a grappling hook is improved to 20 ft. Grappling Weapon: If you are grappling a creature via the grappling special feature of a weapon, a rope attached to that weapon counts as secure for the duration of the grapple. Piton: You may draw a piton and rope and attempt to set it in an object or creature within reach as a standard action, dealing 1d4 + Strength modifier damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must succeed on a melee attack to place the piton on a creature. A creature can remove a set piton as a move action with a Strength check equal to this spheres DC. If you fail to deal damage, your attempt fails. Tie: You also may simply secure a rope to a suitable point within reach (a pillar, post, chandelier, etc.) as a standard action. Any creature within reach may untie this rope as a standard action. Once your rope is secured by any of the above methods, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the rope or weapons reach (as determined from the anchor point), to a maximum of 30 ft. without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by making a Climb check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. Use your reach (not threatened area) to determine the maximum movement length when using a weapon from the flail group for this ability. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. You may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling if you succeed on a Climb check against the surfaces DC. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or creatures, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the ropes reach). You must have a free hand to use this ability. Movement using this ability counts as climbing for the purpose of the (climb) packages movement bonuses. For every 4 ranks in Climb you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this talent. If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you may replace the movement portion of that talent with the movement granted by this talent. Ropes or weapons affixed to creatures by any method above allow both the creature to which the rope is affixed (the target) and the creature holding the rope or weapon (the holder) to attempt drag and reposition combat maneuvers against each other. The holder may always choose to drop the rope or weapon as a free action on his turn or as an immediate action off-turn. Example: Azeem the conscript is facing a force of kobolds in a tunnel. Two of them, wielding clubs, have moved adjacent to attack him, while two more are behind a barricade 30 ft. down the tunnel with crossbows. Jorr draws (a move action) and throws (a swift action) his grappling hook to attach it to the overhead scaffolding 25 ft. away, then attempts to swing to just behind the crossbow-wielding kobolds to a space 35 ft. from his current position, 10 ft. beyond the anchor point. Jorr must make a Climb check and compare it to the CMDs of all four kobolds, since two are adjacent to his starting position and two adjacent to his ending position. If he succeeds, he moves without provoking attacks of opportunity, springing over the heads of the nearby kobolds, swinging over the barricade and kicking off the tunnel wall to land beyond the far foe. Errata: Releasing or unsecuring a rope after a swing is a free action. (Source)"

This is not intelligence, it is simply learned mannerisms that conveniently allow an animal to react to both simple and complex social situations, and react appropriately to questions and conversations as though it understood languages the handler possessed at the time they taught the animal this trick. In addition, when attempting a Disguise check to alter an animals appearance, the Disguise check takes no penalties due to different gender, race, age, or size category. Disguising an animal in this way may be as simple as putting a hat on a bear to applying full makeup and costumery to a salamander. An animal disguised this way does not automatically draw attention to itself, though it may draw suspicion if it does not behave appropriately to a situation. You may substitute your Handle Animal bonus in place of your Disguise bonus when attempting this check.

            "benefit": "As a variant-rule to the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery legendary talent, GMs may allow characters to tame other intelligent creatures to aid and assist them as companions. This optional variant rule should be treated the same as a legendary talent. It is powerful and potentially world altering and should be handled with care and allowed with supervision. Rule: Characters with the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery (handle animal) legendary talent may tame creatures of any type and of any intelligence. GMs have ultimate control over what creatures are appropriate to be tamed. Intelligent creatures tamed this way are recruited similarly to a Leadership sphere cohort, attempting a Handle Animal check against a base DC of 10 + the Hit Dice of the creature you are looking to tame. This check is not modified by Settlement Size Modifiers or Miscellaneous Modifiers but can be modified by circumstantial elements by GM discretion. Context and Reasoning: A primary pillar of balance for the Beastmastery sphere is that it is not the Leadership feat or the Leadership sphere. The Beastmastery sphere is limited to taming and handling creatures with animal intelligence (2 Intelligence or less). This is because a creature with 3 Intelligence or greater is considered sapient, rather than just sentient. A sapient creature is one capable of complex thoughts, expressions, and actions. Put simply, intelligent creatures are intelligent. As of this handbook, the only way to recruit another fully-intelligent creature as a companion is through the Leadership sphere Advanced Cohorts (cohort) legendary talent, which is the same talent used to recruit people, or otherwise recapture the original strength of the Leadership feat. While this is a valid option for those looking to recruit outsiders and other adventurers, or realistically anything you come across, it often comes as a disconnect that the Beastmastery sphere cannot gain magical creatures as companions, such as a talented beastmaster coming across a noble unicorn but being unable to recruit or convince them to join them any better than another character. This sphere-specific variant rule functions primarily as an adjustment to the Mindless Mastery legendary talent as the capstone of being a tamer, allowing a Beastmastery practitioner to tame any creature. This only functions as the handle animal packages tame ability for counting the tamed creatures Hit Dice against the total number of Hit Dice a character may control and differs in nearly every other aspect. When allowing intelligent creatures to be tamed through Beastmastery, GMs should be aware of and consider the following:"

Improved Familiars have always lost their ability to speak with other creatures of their kind because most improved familiar options can already talk or understand languages. GMs may find it appropriate to remove this change and allow improved familiars with familiar archetypes. This will often be an upgrade over a normal improved familiar but will not offer any unusual increases in power that would not be otherwise available. Rule: The Improved Familiar feat and Improved Pet legendary talent do not remove a familiar's ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Improved familiars may take familiar archetypes that would remove the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind."

Restricting the druid to rideable creatures only would grant to separate companions as the effective druid levels for both companions could not combine. While as written this works, GMs should review whether they want a character to have control of multiple companions and consider how that may affect the flow of combat and gameplay. Players, on the other hand, should consider whether they actually want multiple companions, or if they do not want the extra resources and stat blocks to manage.

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "Whether excavated, purified, or procured through other means, distant worlds and strange planes are often the home of new materials, many of which are useful for magic. Alchemical power components were first introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurers Armory and planar power components were introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Plane-Hoppers Handbook. Planar power components are treated as alchemical reagents which amplify magical effects. The Realmwalkers Handbook introduces a number of new planar power components which can be used for either classic spellcasting or spherecasting. Planar power components function similarly to alchemical reagents, with a few notable alterations. A planar power component can be used as a consumable, additional material component or as a reusable focus when casting a spell or sphere effect, as though the caster were using the Material Casting or Focus Casting general casting drawbacks. Using a planar power component does not increase a spell or sphere effects casting time, even if it would add a metamagic feats effects. A planar power components effects do not stack with either themselves or one another. As such, only a single planar power component can be included when casting a spell or sphere effect. Each planar power component notes the type of spells and sphere effects it is usable with, the number required when used as a material component (noted as doses) or as an additional focus (noted as focus), and the effects of the component when used. Planar Component Foci as Crafted Equipment: When a caster makes frequent use of planar power components as foci for their magics, it is common for to affix or craft the components into a held, slotted, or otherwise worn item, such as lining the head of a casters staff or creating a simple broach or ring, to be used as the focus. Integrating a planar power component into an item does not cost any additional gold or resources (beyond the base item) and requires a number of doses of the planar power component sufficient to be used as a focus. If the resulting item is heavily composed of or incorporates the component in a more permanent manner, such as crafting the base of an amulet out of the material rather than just socketing it or reforging a swords hilt out of the material, it may require a craftsman to safely craft the item, usually with a DC 15 Craft check of the appropriate kind and a few hours. The same check may be made to safely remove the components from the item, reclaiming the power components without destroying or harming the original item. There is no penalty for a failed check."

An impaled creature cannot move and is battered for as long as it remains impaled. An impaled creature who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + your CMB + spell level), or lose the spell. Weapons used to impale a creature cannot be used for attacks except for those against the impaled creature (you cannot impale more than a single creature with your unarmed strikes), ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield bonuses to AC. A creature can only be impaled by a single weapon; attempting to impale an already impaled creature automatically fails. Controlling an impaling weapon requires the same amount of hands as wielding the weapon does. This impalement may be broken when you lose control of the weapon used for the attack (such as by being disarmed), or by the impaled creature making a combat maneuver check as a standard action with a DC equal to your CMD. If you control the weapon being used to impale a creature, you may choose to automatically remove the weapon as a move action. When the impaled creature loses the impaled condition, they take bleed damage equal to the damage dice of the weapon used to impale the creature. If a creature is impaled by a weapon that is not controlled by another creature, they are able to move, but all movement speeds they possess are reduced by 1/2 (minimum 5 ft.). You must make an opposed Strength check against the impaled creature to move as a part of the move action (this Strength check is made by your mount if you are mounted), moving up to half of your base speed while the impaled creature is dragged along with you (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If you are impaling two or more creatures, you must make an opposed Strength check against all currently impaled creatures in order to move, and if you are subjected to forced movement, you must make an opposed Strength check against all impaled creature; failing this check against any impaled creature forces you to release any weapons youre using to impale a creature (or to end impaling a creature with your unarmed strikes or natural attacks) immediately, while success drags any impaled creatures with you during this forced movement. You can also choose to release the weapon as a free action without dealing damage (although you cannot release natural weapons). A creature may attempt a grapple check against an impaled creatures CMD to assume control of the weapon impaling that creature as long as another creature is not controlling it. If so, the creature making the attempt receives a +4 bonus on the grapple check.

The door can be plainly visible or disguised within its environment requiring a Perception check to spot (with the DC of a normal trap). The door can be forced open with a Strength check opposed by your Craft (traps) DC +5. The door is strong enough to support a large object or creature and increases the maximum size category it can support by 1 for every 3 ranks in Craft (trap) you possess. Objects made of stone or heavier substances count as one size category heavier, while soft objects such as cloth count as one size category lighter. In addition when you create the door you can give it any of the traits from the list below. Unless otherwise stated a trait can be deactivated or reactivated as a standard action by you, or it can be disabled as if a Trap sphere trap by others. A trap door requires 1 minute to craft and lasts for 1 hour. If you possess the Persistent Trap talent its crafting period can be increased to 10 minutes to last for 24 hours (and does not count towards the limit of the amount of traps you can have with the Persistent Trap talent)."

When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target: If an effect would move you away from your grappled target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled targets CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled. A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round).

If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which would move your grappled target out of your grapple. Examples: Grappling is a complex and often confusing combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better demonstrate how this talent is used. If your grappled target is being moved away from you: A creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an item. If you are being moved away from your grappled target: If a creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against your grappled target.

If you attempt to destroy the creatures vitals a second time while the creature is suffering from these penalties, and the creature fails their Fortitude save, the creatures vitals are destroyed, killing them.

You may select the profession and martial tradition you are looking for, and may also specify a particular race from those available. Not all races, professions, and traditions will be available in all locations; the available pool is determined by the GM. The base DC of this check is 10 + the Hit Dice of the person you are looking to recruit, modified per Settlement Size Modifier and Miscellaneous Modifier tables. Modifiers are cumulative. You may take 10 on this check. You may not recruit a creature with more Hit Dice than the maximum shown on Table: Cohort. The exact feats and talents the cohort possesses are up to the GM, though you may reject a given cohort and attempt to recruit another with the normal action. Recruits are usually humanoids with no racial Hit Dice, and are of races available in the region you are recruiting. Creatures with racial Hit Dice, templates, or abilities unsuitable to player races are not suitable to be cohorts. You may have multiple recruited creatures under your control, but their total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Diplomacy. If you attempt to recruit a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose which other creatures to release from your service. A cohort serves you loyally and will follow you into and aid you during combat, but will not obey obviously suicidal orders nor subject itself to harm for no obvious purpose. Cohorts are usually within 1 alignment step of you, though some exceptions may occur at the GMs discretion. Wiki Note: Effects that increase effective BAB or skill ranks in a sphere do not accelerate the strength of leadership cohorts or similar partners, just as increasing your caster level does not accelerate the hit dice of Conjuration sphere companions. Only effects that actually raise your effective level, such as the Spherebound mythic quality or a Conscript sphere specialization, can increase the hit dice of cohorts and similar companions."

Cohorts begin play with leather armor and a dagger in addition to any equipment listed in their descriptions; further equipment must be supplied to them.

If a cohort is equipped with additional items, the cohort will not keep them if leaving your service. When you gain a level and your ranks in Diplomacy increase, you may assign an additional Hit Die to current cohorts, up to the maximum they may possess and not causing the total Hit Dice you have recruited to exceed your limit. Feats: A cohort begins with one feat, and gains another feat at every odd Hit Die. A cohort may gain any PC feat for which it qualifies. Cohorts may not gain magic item crafting feats. Combat Talents: Cohorts gains talents with the proficient progression. Martial Tradition: Your cohort gains a martial tradition, using the practitioner modifier given by their profession. Ability Score Increase: Just like PCs and Monsters, a cohort gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of your choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed. Enhancement: At 5 Hit Dice, a cohort gains a +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 9th level, they increase this bonus to +4 and gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. At 13th level, the first bonus increases to +6, the second to +4, and they gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. These bonuses may be retrained as if they were a single feat.

The other players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique personality for the cohort, emphasizing that it is a unique person rather than simply a class ability.

Followers can supply unskilled labor for simple tasks, such as clearing a road obstructed by falling rocks. Count the followers as supplying a number of Medium-sized unskilled laborers equal to half the number of followers in the settlement (or caravan). While doing so, the followers cannot provide their other benefits. If attacked, followers will attempt to flee to a safe place to the best of their ability. You normally have about 5 followers per rank in Diplomacy. If statistics are needed for a particular follower, treat them as level 1 commoners. If you possess the Alchemists, Craftsmen, Entertainers, Healers, Merchants, Rangers, or Scholars talents, then there is a 10% chance per talent that a randomly selected follower will be a level 1 expert. When you gain this package, choose a settlement with which you are well acquainted. Your initial followers are drawn from there. When first gaining this package, it is assumed that you have spent time in the past making contacts, deals, and promises and that you are well known enough in the community to attract a group of followers. Should the number of followers available be reduced for any reason, the effectiveness of (followers) talents is reduced, treating your ranks in Diplomacy as equal to the number of available followers/4. You normally regain 1 follower per rank in Diplomacy each day you spend in a settlement where your followers are dispersed, but you can double this number with 8 hours of active effort each day. If you have lost all of your followers or do not disperse your followers in the settlement, the recruitment rate is halved (minimum 1 follower per day). If using the downtime rules found in Ultimate Campaign, having your followers present in a settlement increases the effect of Influence or Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of 1 additional Influence or Labor for every 2 followers in the settlement where the downtime activity takes place. Any talents that enable followers to make checks to generate capital receive any benefits from rooms and teams you have access to. If a talent allows followers to generate capital, the entire group of followers makes this check collectively. Any results that are not sufficient to generate capital on a given day may be carried over to the next day; this carrying-over may be continued until the result is sufficient to generate capital or your followers leave the settlement.

A caravan is assumed to be capable of making Survival checks with a DC of 10 + your ranks in Diplomacy to feed itself and 1 additional Medium creature per 5 followers (Medium creatures count as two Small creatures, Large creatures count as two Medium ones) while moving without affecting speed. In harsher environments, the caravan has supplies for 1 week plus 1 day per rank in Diplomacy that you possess. If their Survival check is not more than 5 below the environment DC, they count as only spending half a days supplies. The caravan can make camp, setting up tents, cooking, and performing other camp tasks. Doing so increases the progress a PC can make when crafting while adventuring by 2 hours per day (normally going from 2 hours to 4 hours a day). When you enter a settlement, you can disperse your caravan there, allowing you to gain the benefits of your followers while in that settlement. Gathering a caravan after it has been dispersed requires 1 hour. Note: Your caravan doesnt have to rest at the same time as you do. If the caravan rests while you adventure, they can travel while you rest, carrying a number of Medium creatures equal to your practitioner modifier plus your ranks in Diplomacy. Two Small creatures counts as one Medium creature, two Medium creatures count as one Large creature, etc. A caravan that is attacked in your absence will disperse. A dispersed caravan will reform, regaining 25% of its members every hour after threats are removed.

Likewise, talents that grant additional skills to your followers each lend themselves to having one higher ranking follower direct activities (scouting, trade, crafting) of the group of followers.

Creatures hired with this ability do not count against the number of Hit Dice of cohorts you may have recruited at one time. Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creatures alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. Creatures with no racial Hit Dice and only NPC class levels usually can be hired for half of the price of others. Few, if any, creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal. However, at the GMs discretion, if the task is strongly aligned with the creatures ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment."

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers that act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat. A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal swarm rules. Traits: A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. All troops gain the following traits. Troop Subtype: A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single armor class. A troop makes saving throws as a single creature. A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shape-able, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures. The exact number of a troops component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Immunity to being Tripped or Bull Rushed: A troop cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, except by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent. Immunity to Single Target Spells: A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate and multiple target spells such as haste), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as fireball or mass hold monster). Vulnerable to Area Effect Spells: A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage. Troop Attack: Creatures with the troop subtype dont make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troops stat block has troop in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice. Unless stated otherwise, a troops attacks are non-magical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attacks damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troops attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and attempt attacks of opportunity as normal with their troop attack. Chaos of Combat: Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save."

Whenever the user makes an attack with the weapon during their turn, they can expend a charge from the gadget in order to connect the projectile to the weapon with a cord (or connect the user directly to a thrown weapon). This limits the maximum range of the weapon to close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks in Craft (mechanical)). If the attack misses its target, the cord simply automatically retracts itself (taking its fired or thrown projectile back with it if you so desire), but if the attack successfully hits its target, the projectile latches on, and links the weapon (or the attacker) and the target together. The attacker and the target cannot exceed the maximum distance of the cord unless: If the attacker chooses the cord to retract to a desired distance, at the end of their turn the cord makes a combat maneuver check using your Craft (mechanical) modifier as its combat maneuver bonus. This attack is compared against both the attackers and targets combat maneuver defense. If the attack exceeds neither creatures combat maneuver defense, nothing happens. If the check exceeds at least one of the creatures defenses, the creature with the lower combat maneuver defense is moved 10 feet (including vertically if necessary) closer towards the other target for every point the check exceeds their combat maneuver defense, or until the cord has retracted the desired amount (this movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity and is halted if it would move them into a solid object or another creature). If both creatures have the same combat maneuver defense, an opposed Strength check determines who gets moved by the cord. For the purposes of this check, objects are considered to have a combat maneuver defense of 15 + their special size modifier. If an object or creature is larger then the cords size limit, it cannot be moved by the cord regardless of the check result (which may result in the creature with the higher CMD to be moved by the cord). Creatures can also choose to be moved by the cord the full distance. If both creatures choose to be moved by the cord, the creature with the lower CMD is moved as normal. If used by the attacker to propel themselves a distance intentionally, this movement is considered both jumping and flying for the purposes of benefiting from the Athletics sphere. The attacker can choose fire the other end of the cable (i.e. the one they have connected to themselves or their weapon) against a target within close range of the first target. If the attack succeeds, then both targets are now considered to be connected to one another. If the attacker fires the other end of the cable during the same turn they fired the first part of the cable, the attacks are not limited to targets within close range, instead both targets must be within close range of one another. A creature can be affected by multiple cords at once, but cannot be successfully moved more than once per your turn. Instead the maximum size limit is increased. The accessory can generate multiple cords at the same time, each one requiring a charge to create. If you select this talent a second time, the cords maximum length is increased to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per rank in Craft (mechanical)). See its entry above."

Technological ammunition, such as charges for the plasma pistol, plasma rifle, and plasma thrower do not qualify as regular ammunition. If you use an appropriate accessory gadget as part of the raw materials used for the creation of the ammunition, the accessory is subsumed and applied into all of the individual pieces of ammunition (as if they were gadgets with the moddable quality), but still only count as 1 accessory for the purpose of how many accessory talents you can maintain at once. Treat ammunition created this way as a single set. A set shares all charges that the accessory uses, and an individual piece of ammunition cannot be split from its set for more than 1 round without becoming inert. Ammunition and throwing weapons created by the ammo spitter are impermanent and crumble back into their base parts 8 hours after creation, and are always destroyed after an attack whether or not they hit their target. Ammo Spitters, when creating sets of 30 rounds per charge, are assumed to make ammunition for weapons of Medium-size or smaller, however if the weapon is larger than that, you need to gather raw materials.

In addition once per round if your gadget would be successfully influenced, the routine can be set to spend an additional charge from the installed gadgets charge pool to force the foreign force to either attempt another check or grant the gadget another save to prevent the effect (even if it would not normally be allowed an additional save or check otherwise). You may select this talent a second time to grant your routine the ability to detect unseen threats, as well as to trace and destroy enemy influences. You can set the routine to detect enemy threats inside of the gadget (such as undetected routines or sprites), forcing them to attempt another check at the beginning of your turn to remain concealed. The frequency of this check depends on the rate of power consumed. An additional check will be required every hour if no additional charges are consumed, every minute if an additional charge is consumed every hour, or every round if an additional charge is consumed every ten minutes. Once the application detects a foreign routine, at the beginning of your turn it will make you aware of the threat, try to determine its origin and then attempt to purge the routine completely.

It possesses no senses or auditory functions. Automators possess no magic item or augment slots. Automators cannot perform any action that requires an attack roll or combat action, but may perform ability and skill checks (this is left ultimately to the GMs discretion). The exact shape of an automator is determined at the time of creation. An automator can possess up to 2 limbs that must be inbuilt with whatever they wield or use. For instance an automator that can open or close a single door can take the form of a simple box with a pulley that attaches to a door. An automator may be created with only 1 limb in order to increase its movement speed to 5 feet. Automators can work in tandem to accomplish multiple smaller tasks that amount to a singular larger task.

Vehicles possess no magic item or augment slots. It has a land or swim speed of of 40 ft. + 10 ft. for every 5 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical) (chosen at the time of its creation). Vehicles can make a slam attack (1d6 Medium, 1d8 Large) with their body during a charge attack (its reach is always 5 ft. regardless of size), however making an attack with it this way causes it to take half the damage it inflicts onto its own body. The construct gets no actions of its own and must be activated to perform any set of actions. The vehicle may be activated as a standard action, which gives the vehicle its own actions set for that turn (granting it a swift, move, and standard action). When activating a vehicle, you can substitute a required Craft (mechanical) check for a Profession (pilot) check. The creature activating the gadget uses their base attack bonus (or ranks in Craft (mechanical), if higher) + their Intelligence modifier when calculating the weapons attack bonus, with the appropriate size modifiers for the weapons size (i.e., -4 for Gargantuan, etc.). A collapsible vehicle uses 1 charge per 10 minutes of operation (in nonconsecutive 10 minute increments). The base vehicle is not covered, granting creatures easy access to the interior. Soft cover is granted to passengers against creatures outside of the vehicle. If you select this talent a second time you can create covered vehicles. Passengers inside of the vehicle gain total cover, but cannot interact with or make attacks against anything outside the vehicle. Any creature within the vehicle may create an opening as a move action, reducing this bonus to improved cover (+8 to AC, +4 to Reflex saves), allowing the creature to make attacks and interact with targets outside the vehicle. When making an attack in this fashion, targets outside the vehicle gain soft cover against attacks originating from inside the vehicle (+2 AC, +1 Reflex saves). If integrated as part of a drone, this gadget functions differently. It loses the ability to be collapsible however the drone is considered the vehicle, and as such uses the drones statistics, and actions (however the drone uses the vehicle segments movement speed). As drones can be larger or smaller than Medium and Large size, the amount of passengers a vehicle can carry is increased accordingly.

However by spending a charge during a charge action you can have the drill activate its breaker form. This expands it to roughly your size, uses a different set of weapon statistics, and grants you a burrow speed equal to your normal speed for that round. You can burrow through loose dirt and anything with hardness 0 or less with no difficulty, however if during your burrow you encounter something with hardness 1 or greater, you may make a attack with the drill against it for that round. The drill bypasses a point of hardness for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical). If you manage to destroy the obstacle with this attack you may continue forward treating the squares of the destroyed obstacle as difficult terrain. This can allow you to initiate a charge through squares that you do not have line of sight to. You may resolve your charge attack against any valid target within reach of the charges path after passing through the barriers (creature or object) blocking your line of sight.

Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort (such as the Commset gadget) can pick up a beacon signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) or Survival check. Unlike other gadgets a beacons base signal strength is 5 miles (or your gadgets innate signal strength whichever is higher) over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or through water. Beginning at 5 ranks in Craft (mechanical), you can also transmit words in addition to the transmitted location. For every 5 ranks you have in Craft (mechanical), you can transmit 3 words, in addition to the transmitted location. Shelter An emergency shelter is a small, 2-ft. long egg-shaped device. Once activated, the shelter rapidly unfolds and inflates into a hut with composed of a number of contiguous 10-ft. cubes equal to half your ranks in Craft (mechanical) (min 1). Its capable of providing shelter for up to six Medium or Small creatures per cube (a Large creature takes up 4 Medium creature slots, 4 Tiny creatures fit within a single Medium creature slot). This process takes 1 minute to complete. The shelter includes pneumatic spike anchors that can attach it to any ground cover of hardness 8 or less. The interior is lit alchemically in normal light. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, extreme pressure (such as deep sea pressure), and doesnt collapse in void, providing excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 26 degrees Celsius). A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and recycles the internal air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The 1-in. walls are made of dense resin (see sidebar below). You can choose for separate sections of the resin to be transparent or opaque as you desire. The hut cannot float on water. The door is airtight and contains an airlock, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease and exit the shelter without compromising its internal conditions. The hut can be integrated inside of of pre-existing structures buildings or vehicles, with the resin automatically moulding itself to adjust its walls to fit any cracks in the interior. A shelter can be integrated as part of a Large building or vehicle plus an additional size category larger for each additional 10-ft. cube the shelter is composed of. Vehicles with a shelter integrated this way dont benefit from its elemental resistances, but the creatures inside the vehicle still do. The shelter uses up 1 charge per 8 hours (in 8 hour increments) as a rote function, and will automatically deactivate when out of charges. Upon deactivation, all foreign objects and creatures will be harmlessly ejected from the emergency shelter, compacting itself back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute.

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "This gadget creates a lithe, snakelike appendage that can extend an extreme distance. When activated with 1 or more charges, the wearer can use the extendo appendage to either move themselves or other creatures and objects within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks in Craft (mechanical)). The extendo appendage is not dextrous enough to wield weapons or perform actions requiring finesse but is capable of making unarmed strikes (this does not grant extra attacks). An anatomical structure arm can be combined with an extendo appendage in order to grant it the dexterity of a normal hand and the ability to wield weapons, but still only occupies the slot that the extendo appendage occupies, and does not require additional charges for base functionality (but you may still spend extra charges to double maximum weight capacity). If used to attack, the extendo limb may be used to perform melee attacks against targets within range (including combat maneuvers) or lift other objects (this does not increase your threatened area). Once per turn as a free action, you can plant/detach one extendo appendage on/off a flat, stable, unoccupied surface within range. By suspending yourself from the planted appendage, you may move yourself anywhere within close range of the planted square as a movement action (including vertically and diagonally). If you have multiple extendo appendages planted, you must remain in range of each of them. If you possess the Combat Limbs legendary Tech sphere talent, you can substitute extendo appendage in place of a single anatomical structure arm. You may make miniaturized versions of the extendo appendages. They are too small to make attacks or to suspend yourself but they can be used to hold and move objects at least 3 sizes smaller than your size category. A sensory set can be combined with the appendage in order to provide sensation to an area within close range (such as using an eyeball to peek behind a wall), and does not require a slot, and not require extra charges for base functionality (but you may still spend extra charges to use improvements as normal). You can select this talent a second time if you have at least 10 ranks in Craft (mechanical) to increase the extendo limbs reach to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per rank in Craft (mechanical)). An extendo appendage can be attached to the body, arm, or leg slot, and mini extendo limbs do not require a slot, and can be attached to other augments. Extendo limbs use 1 charge per hour in use. Failing a Will save against Remote Control allows the controller to maneuver you around with the limb, or attack with the limb on their turn using their own base attack bonus and your ability modifiers."

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You gain access to the following gadget schematics. Fire Extinguisher This cylindrical device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-ft. cone of misty vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. The fire extinguisher uses up 1 charge per use. Against magical fire effects, such as those created by a wall of fire or similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as those of a flaming weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguishers area of effect. When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 ranks of Craft (mechanical) (minimum 1d6) (Reflex for half). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilatedusing a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GMs discretion). Flashlight When activated, a flashlight creates a beam of normal light in a 60-ft. cone. You may attach the flashlight to an item slot as part of the same action used to activate the gadget, otherwise the gadget must be held until attached to an item slot as a move action. The direction of the cone is chosen once each round as a free action. It also increases the light level in the area beyond this initial cone by one step, out to a 120-ft. cone. It does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. Against magical darkness, the flashlight may expend an additional charge to suppresses the magical darkness (turning it into regular darkness) for 1 minute before the darkness overwhelms the light. In normal conditions, the flashlight uses up 1 charge per 8 hours of use as a rote action and can be integrated into a drone without counting towards the maximum number of integrated gadgets it may possess. Respirator When activated, a respirator forms a mask over the face of the wearer which creates a vacuum seal, scrubbing the air which the wearer breathes out, allowing them to breathe in contaminated areas or oxygen deprived areas (including underwater environments) so long as the respirator has power. Variations of this gadget exist for creatures dependent on different environments. Aquatic creatures for example may have a respirator that allows them to breathe outside of water. Generally, the respirator gadget does not prevent the use of other head slot items such as circlets, crowns, hats, and hoods. The respirator uses up 1 charge per hour of use. Drones dont usually need respirators, however a drone with a integrated respirator may activate theirs for willing adjacent creatures."

        "gravity clip (drone, gadget)": {
            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "A gravity clip is a small, disc-shaped device that can be attached to an area, creature, melee weapon, or object with different effects based on target. Attaching a clip to a square in your space, yourself, or an object or melee weapon you are holding requires only a move action, which automatically activates the device. Removing an attached clip is a standard action, which immediately deactivates and expends any remaining charges. To target an area with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) against a solid space within range to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the clip to create an area of light or heavy gravity (chosen at time of activation) with a radius of up to 5 ft. + 5 ft. for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical), and expend a single charge at the start of each round. The clip may also be used to normalize gravity. This functions to turn areas of, light, heavy or no gravity into areas of normal gravity. This may be used to provide normal gravity to either an area with a radius of up to 5 ft. + 5 ft. for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical) or for a single building, structure or vehicle with a maximum size of Colossal. Using the gravity this way requires a single charge for an hour of use and is a rote function. To target a creature with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will activate, causing the creature to act as if in light or heavy gravity (chosen at time of activation), and expend a single charge at the start of each round. To target a melee weapon with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the weapons mass to modulate with each successful attack on the moment of impact, via the manipulation of the gravity fields around the weapon. Each successful hit against a target consumes a charge from a gravity clip and causes the damage from the hit to resolve as if the weapon were one size category smaller or larger (chosen at time of activation) than its actual size. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as those granted by the spell lead blades. To target an object that isnt a weapon, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the object to double or halve its density. Mechanically, this doubles or halves the objects weight, and causes the object to count as one category lighter or heavier for the purposes of the Telekinesis sphere and other effects. The clip will expend a single charge at the start of each round. You may attach the gravity clip to a different ranged weapon as long as the weapon fires a physical projectile, and use its range increments for its effect, however in that case this ability is no longer a touch attack even if the weapon itself would be. Heavy Gravity: In heavy gravity areas, Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, and Swim checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character's speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character's strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters that fall in areas of heavy gravity take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 ft. fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage. Light Gravity: Characters in an area of light gravity gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and on Acrobatics and Ride checks. All items weigh half as much, and weapon ranges double. Strength and Dexterity don't change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. Falling characters in light gravity take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 ft. fallen (maximum 20d4)."

The jet-boosters once activated, grant a fly speed of 60 ft. with poor maneuverability. If the wearer successfully hovers near ground level, she obscures visibility as though she was Large size and had the Hover feat. The exhaust isnt hot or concentrated enough to be used as a weapon. The jet-boosters use up 1 charge per round of use. Jet-boosters can be operated in slow burn mode as a rote function, giving the wearer a fly speed of 30 ft. with perfect maneuverability and consuming 1 charges per 4 hours (in consecutive 4 hour periods). You cannot fly while carrying anything other than a light load while in this mode. In addition, this fly speed only allows you to maintain yourself a 3 ft. above the surface of the ground. If you are higher than that on the end of your turn, you glides to 3 ft. above the ground, taking no falling damage. Jet-boosters operated in slow burn do not obscure visibility. Jet-boosters can be operated in overdrive, giving the wearer a fly speed of 90 ft. with clumsy maneuverability and consuming 2 charges per round (instead of the normal 1 per round). As a standard action, jet-booster canisters may be attached to an unwilling creature with a successful melee touch attack, and activated as part of the same action. At the end of each of your turns, the active jet-boosters will consume a charge and forcefully move the creature 30 feet in a direction of your choice (which can be changed as a movement action by Remote Control). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures with attached jet-boosters can remove them from themselves by spending a standard action on their turn. As an alternative the jet-boosters can be designed to function underwater, and grant propulsion underwater the same way they can grant a flight speed above ground, except that creatures gain a swim speed instead of fly speed. When used underwater, creatures with ranks in the Swim skill may attempt a Swim check vs. your Tech sphere saving throw to reduce the forced movement by half. Aquatic jet-boosters used on slow burn are not limited to being only 3 feet above ground. The type of booster this talent functions as must be chosen at the time of creation."

Unless otherwise stated, this does not stack with other abilities that increase the maximum size of weapons you may wield, but does stack with other effects that increase effective carrying capacity.

The cloud-like effect can have no larger of a radius than 10 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 ranks in Craft (mechanical). Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within the gadget counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and harmlessly expelled from the device, breaking the pneumatic box, should their gaseous form expire). While the cloud or gaseous form is contained, if the pneumatic box should break (hardness 8, hit points 10), the device immediately deactivates. When deactivated, any gas, fog, smoke, or similar cloud-like effect is expelled as a breath weapon, filling a 60-ft. cone (or the clouds original area, if smaller).

You can even choose to designate a target that you have no line of sight to, as long as it broadcasts a signal, and you are within its signal range. The missiles travels up to 800 ft. on your turn towards its target, following a path of least deviation. However the missiles are capable of course correction, turning itself on your turn 90 degrees a number of times equal to 1 + 1 per 5 ranks you have in Craft (mechanical). If the missile does not reach its target in the same round it is launched, the missile may be attacked, having a touch AC equal to your Craft (mechanical) modifier, 1 hit point, and automatically fails any saves as an unattended object. Any missiles that reach their maximum range before reaching their target, stop flying and becomes a harmless dud. Once a missile reaches its target, it explodes into an area of effect dealing 1d4 damage, half bludgeoning and half fire damage to each creature or object in a 5-ft. radius burst (Reflex half). For every rank you have in Craft (mechanical), you may launch an additional missile during your turn at no additional charge cost. If you shoot multiple missiles you may allocate your targets however you wish, having each missile strike a different target or the same target. Creatures or objects that are in the area of multiple missile explosions at once combine all their base damage together, make a single Reflex save for half damage, and are treated as a single area of effect for the purposes of dealing damage to swarms.

Consider the turret a 1 HD construct with average hit points, hardness as well as saving throws for a gadget, size equal to the weapon, no ability scores except Strength and Dexterity scores of 10, an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your ranks in Craft (mechanical), movement speed of 0, a bonus to Perception checks equal to your Craft (mechanical) bonus (with a -5 penalty for lacking a Wisdom score) and a base attack bonus equal to your ranks in Craft (mechanical). Turrets possess no magic item or augment slots. The setup or disassembly of a turret takes a full-round action and can be placed on a floor or on walls or ceilings with some ingenuity and extra time (Such as using pitons or glue). Activating a turret is a standard action. Once activated a turret can be given a command as part of the same action to target a specific target. The turret will attack the target to the best of its ability until the target is destroyed (or is out of line sight for 1 round or more) making a single attack with the attached weapon each turn on your initiative. An unmanned turret's bonus to hit with the attached weapon is equal to your practitioner modifier plus 1-1/2 times your ranks in Craft (mechanical). Turrets can reload themselves automatically, but reloading a weapon with a reload time of a standard or full-round action, takes place of their attack for the turn. A turret can only ever make 1 attack per round. A turret requires 1 charge per minute of operation (in 1 minute nonconsecutive increments). Turrets may also be fired manually. In which case firing it requires the users own actions every time its used in such a way (Such as using a standard action to use a special attack action). The creature activating the gadget uses your base attack bonus + your practitioner modifier (or their own, if higher) when calculating the weapons attack bonus, with the appropriate size modifiers for the weapons size (i.e., -4 for Gargantuan, etc.). When used manually the controller may make attack actions and apply feats and martial talents to attacks made with this Turret as if it were a weapon the controller is wielding even if using the weapon remotely. Weapons used this way are treated both as their base weapon and as technological weapons for purposes of weapon proficiency. Turrets may also be integrated into drones as long as they are two sizes smaller than the size of the drone, granting the turret a measure of mobility. Integrated turrets can be used manually and are sundered as wielded weapons."

Creating a generator requires a gathering of raw materials, weight and construction time similar to that of a drone, and you can make a generator with a size equivalent to the maximum/minimum of a drone you can create except you cannot create a generator with a size smaller than Small. Setting up a generator requires it to remain on a stable flat surface for the duration of its activation (difficult terrain counts as an unstable surface). Activating a generator requires 1 minute multiplied by two for every size category larger than Small the generator is. Generators cannot be reduced in size, reduced in weight, or placed in extradimensional storage (such as bags of holding) without deactivating. Once activated generators output power at a rate of 1 charge a round + 1 charge per every 5 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical). For every size category larger than Small multiply this output by 3 (times three at Medium, times six at Large, etc.). Charges stored in non-battery gadgets from the generator still count against your maximum charge pool (excluding permanent gadgets). You can attach/detach any number of gadgets to a generator as a swift action and split the charges it outputs between any number of them. Attached gadgets cannot be moved further than 5 feet away from the generator without detaching. Drones may possess generators as innate gadgets that are at least 2 sizes smaller than themselves. They may use the generator to power their own functions or to supply power to outside gadgets. If the drone with the innate generator suffers a critical hit, the generator is destroyed in the process. A generator built into a drone is considered to always be on a stable surface for this purpose, however if the drone it is built into is reduced in size or weight (such as through magical effects), or stored in an extradimensional manner the generator still stops functioning. If a generator is made to self destruct, such as through the Self Destruct talent, treat it as possessing a number of charges equal to the number it can output in a round.

This line starts from any corner of the wielder's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it cannot penetrate. When using an automatic weapon to attack all creatures in a line, the wielder makes a separate attack roll against each creature in the line. Each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not affect an automatic weapon's line attack. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately. A single burst with an automatic weapon consumes 10 charges or uses of ammunition. If the wielder of this weapon possesses the Barrage sphere, they can choose to spend their martial focus to make additional line attacks as if making a barrage attack. The same area can be targeted by the same burst twice, and apply (blitz) talents to every creature in said lines. Semi-Automatic: A semi-automatic weapon normally fires one shot as an attack. However, the user can take a special attack action to fire twice, as if using the Barrage sphere's barrage ability (including taking a -2 penalty on all attacks), except using the Barrage sphere this way does not allow the user to expend martial focus for additional attacks. If the wielder has the Barrage sphere's barrage ability, they can instead count their base attack bonus as five points higher exclusively for the purposes of qualifying for additional attacks when martial focus is expended.

A drone possesses its own hit points, armor class, saving throws, and ability scores. It can carry items like a horse or wagon can. However, unlike other construct creatures, drones cannot act, move, or attack on their own. Drones are mindless, even compared to other constructs. Unless otherwise stated, they possess only a Strength and Dexterity score, with no skill points or feats or magic item slots. If a controller makes an attack action with a drone, they use their own base attack bonus and the drones Strength or Dexterity scores to calculate the attacks. A drone must first be activated to perform actions, but a drone doesn't lose charges for simply being active unless utilizing innate gadgets; a drone with 0 hit points or no charges remaining will automatically deactivate at the end of its turn. In order to perform actions, a creature must be adjacent to the drone (or have it within signal range if they possess a remote control), and spend a standard action operating the drone. The drone may take a full turn of actions at the time it is operated, but cannot take more than one turn per round (i.e., so long as the creator or another creature has piloted the drone that round, another creature cannot make actions with the drone unless he impedes the piloting creature from controlling the drone for 1 round). Piloting a drone functions similarly to activating it, and requires a Craft (mechanical) check against your Tech sphere DC (as the drone piloting action). The controller may make attack actions and apply feats and combat talents to attacks made with drones as if they were made by the controller. You always succeed at piloting your own drones. Rather than exclusively being composed of the components gathered during the day, each drone is composed of further parts that are found and/or processed over dedicated workdays. This time may always be waived by simply paying for the parts directly removing the need for the additional time investment altogether. While the specific kind of material is not set in stone, it is considered to be expensive or rare material components for the purpose of the Creation sphere and similar spells or abilities. Finding the parts requires 8 hours of per workday. This period does not require a comfortable environment, is not limited to an investment of 8 hours per day, and need not be consecutive. However the parts gathered for a drone can only be used for a drone its size or smaller. You can repair an drone for an amount of hp equal to his ranks in Craft (mechanical) with 1 hour of work or heal them completely full with 8 hours of work. All drones are created proficient with simple weapons. While not proficient in any armor, a drone can wear barding. However, most drones do not wear barding as they are considered to always be wearing armor with an AC bonus determined by its Hit Dice. This armor may be enchanted, but at twice the normal cost. Drones gain a stat bonus increase for every 4 Hit Dice, just like other creatures. A drone gains the base form outlined below.

Its type is artificial intelligence, and it counts as a construct for all effects that target creature type. Initiative: The installed AI modifies its initiative check with its Intelligence modifier, not its Dexterity modifier. Senses: An AI needs access to a drone, cameras, microphones, or other mechanical sensory tools in order to be able to notice things in the outside world. These senses should be listed in the appropriate encounter areas, not in the AIs stats, since it is likely that an AI will have access to a variety of sensory devices over a large area. Defenses: An AI does not have AC, hit points, or other statistics related to a physical form; it relies on its host or structure for those scores. An AI uses its own saving throws only against attacks that target its mind - in most cases, this means it primarily uses its Will save. An AI uses its CR as its effective Hit Dice for determining its base saves it has good Will saves and poor Fortitude and Reflex saves. Base Attack Bonus: An AI possess a base attack bonus equal to its level. Ability Scores: An AIs base ability scores are 14, 12, and 10 AI possess no innate physical ability scores. Arrange them in any order desired. For every 2 levels it possesses, it gains a + 2 bonus to an ability score. An AI is immune to ability damage but is not immune to ability drain and can be targeted through the gadget it is installed inside of. Skills: An AI has skill points equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per level. An AI has a number of class skills equal to its Charisma modifier. These may be any skill, though the most common class skills for AIs are: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge all, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. Feats: An AI has a number of feats equal to half its level minimum 1. An AI must meet all prerequisites of its feats. Languages: AIs speak one language chosen at the time of their creation.

You can \"push\" a Beta AI to execute a command it does not know as a standard action against a Craft (mechanical) DC of 25 but you cannot push an Alpha AI to execute a command it does not know. An AI can execute the following animal tricks as commands (using Craft (mechanical) in place of Handle Animal). The AI must be housed in a gadget (usually a drone) that can execute those commands if asked: Aid, attack, bombard, build simple structure, bury, come, defend, deliver, demolish, detect, down, exclusive, fetch, flank, flee, guard, guide, heel, maneuver, pose as scenery (as inert gadget), receive spell, rescue, seek, serve, stay, subdue, work. In addition the following are AI exclusive commands: Communicate (DC 20): The AI can communicate very simple concepts through speech, primitive body movements or displaying text on a screen. The AI's vocabulary is very limited, usually knowing about 200 words (about as much as a toddler). The AI is not very capable of creating organic dialogue and sticks to responding with pre-scripted questions or replies. Operate Gadget (DC 15): The AI learns how to operate a number of gadgets equal to your practitioner modifier. An AI does not need to attempt activation checks for gadgets created by you. An AI counts a drone and all its innate gadgets as 1 gadget for the purposes of this command. This command can be taught multiple times, each time increasing the amount of gadgets it can operate by your practitioner modifier. Sort (DC 10): The AI can sort basic information into a multitude of ways. This information is usually pure data in digital form, but even physical objects can be interacted with in this way if the AI possesses a way to manipulate and sense them. Transfer (DC 10): The AI transfers itself and any number of other routines (that you created) and knows how to use on the same gadget to another gadget within signal range. Trigger (DC 10): The AI attempts to execute any amount of other commands it knows when a specific circumstance is met. For example, if it is alerted by a routine of an enemy gadget's signal, it might upload a virus to its location. This command can be taught multiple times, each time granting another set of triggering circumstances and things to do when they are met."

Procedures use Craft (mechanical) in place of Spellcraft checks, use your ranks in Craft (mechanical) in place of your caster level, and use your practitioner modifier in place of your casting ability modifier. Using a Procedure: Similarly to rituals the practitioner must possess a written copy of the procedure, and must have deciphered it beforehand, which functions like deciphering a ritual book, and pay an associated material component cost. There is no procedure equivalent to ritual scrolls. They also possess an associated base sphere as normal. A practitioner counts as having a number of base spheres equal to 3 + 1 for every 4 ranks of Craft (mechanical) they possess when they first receive their first Tech sphere talent. Procedures may be researched like rituals if the practitioner possesses the Develop Procedures item creation feat. The GM is free to put additional limitations on procedures as he sees fit to enable the worldbuilding, such as requiring them to be conducted in specialized facilities (with different facilities enabling different schools of magic) that may limit the highest possible level of procedure to be conducted. Incantations: Incantations can also be easily adapted to come from a technological source and not a magical one.

A creature cannot create a technical item dependent on an ability they cannot use due to a martial tradition or setting framework drawback. Additionally, the crafter must supply materials whose cost is equal to 1/2 the base cost of the item to be created. When creating an item that requires an existing object, the object must be supplied separately. Finally, the crafter needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to create a technical item. The crafter must spend 8 hours (1 day) per 1,000 gp in the items base cost crafting the technical item. Formulae, poisons, widgets and gizmos, only take 2 hours to craft if their base cost is 250 gp or lower, but all other items require a minimum of 8 hours to create. The crafter spends the materials required to create the item at the beginning of the crafting process, and cannot create more than one item per day. A creature cannot spend more than 8 hours per day crafting. The days spend crafting need not be consecutive. Crafting must be done in 4 hour blocks at a minimum. If a crafter is working in an area that is distracting or dangerous (such as in the back of a wagon or in an area that is not quiet), they net only half benefit from time spent crafting. A creator can attempt to work on crafting a technical item throughout a day of adventuring (spending time during meals or their shift during watch to do what work they can), but the combination of distracting environments and lack of time mean they only net 2 hours of crafting per day spent in this fashion. At the end of the crafting period, the creator must attempt a single skill check (determined by the nature of the item in question) to determine if the item was created correctly. Failing this check means that the item does not function correctly and the materials and time are wasted.

Very Rare Guns: If early firearms exist, but are very rare, so much so that even the gunslinger class is restricted to only NPCs, limit the number of times a character may take Mechanical Ranged Weaponry to only twice. Emerging Guns: If early firearms are more common, and the gunslinger class is available to PCs, but advanced firearms are still relatively rare, characters should not be limited with Mechanical Ranged Weaponry, but probably still restricted from the Superior Mechanical Ranged Weaponry legendary talent. This is generally considered the standard for many Pathfinder Campaign Settings. Commonplace Guns: If firearms are very common, so much so that they are now considered martial weapons (instead of exotic), characters who invest a single talent into Mechanical Ranged Weaponry should unlock both exotic crossbows and early firearms. Investing a second talent should unlock advanced firearms. Superior Mechanical Ranged Weaponry if allowed, should be available to PCs with two talents invested in Mechanical Ranged Weaponry (instead of 3). Guns Everywhere: If firearms are so common that they are considered simple weapons (instead of exotic), characters who invest a single talent into Mechanical Ranged Weaponry, should unlock exotic crossbows, early firearms, and advanced firearms as if investing three talents. Players should treat the first instance of Superior Mechanical Ranged Weaponry not as a legendary talent but as a basic talent. The second instance of Superior Mechanical Ranged Weaponry should still be treated as a legendary talent unless other technological weapons are available on the open market."

Some groups may find that having advanced, non-magical robots, laser-swords, and miraculous medical marvels borne purely of chemistry breaks the established mold for their setting. To account for this, use setting frameworks as a guide for how best to integrate technology into your setting. Setting frameworks are sets of drawbacks for the Alchemy, Tech, and Trap sphere, as well as a suggested list of what talents are more or less appropriate for that type of setting (as these drawbacks would be based upon the settings limitations and not the characters, they could not be bought off with talents). Setting framework drawbacks would also be applied to any crafted technical items if that optional ruleset is being used. These frameworks are written with the idea that technology is different in every setting, more or less advanced, or perhaps nonexistent! Maybe your technology is really just small constructs powered by woodland critters, or merely a different subset of magical abilities. Regardless, use setting frameworks as a guideline when determining how best to integrate Alchemy, Tech, and Trap spheres mechanics into your setting.

In addition, you may expend martial focus to issue a command to an AI (or multiple, if using the full-round action granted by this talent) one step faster (full-round action > standard > move > swift). Transmission: Remote Control: Your gizmos and mechanoids can be activated, used, or piloted by a transmitter, so long as the gizmo or mechanoid is within the transmitters signal range. Activating a gizmo or mechanoid is separate from remotely controlling it. You could activate a gadget at range and then spend the necessary actions to use its gizmo abilities (such as turning on an Emergency Set fire extinguisher and having it spray mist or foam, but the fire extinguisher could not be oriented without outside help; if the gizmo would make an attack roll, the user suffers 50% miss chance if they cannot see the attacked target, but a means of remote viewing is sufficient). Note: Using remote control to activate an unattended gizmo requires that gizmos be unattended with intention. For example, if placing an Emergency Set flashlight down, the creature would need to orient the flashlight like a normal object, and activating it remotely would have the light go in that direction. Transportation: Mass Deployment: You may pilot any number of activated mechanoids within your natural reach as a full-round action.

If you could craft a prosthetic with more than 1 secondary function, only a single secondary function may have multiple options selected. Computation: Multifunctional Routines: Any number of routines installed into the same host gizmo may be activated simultaneously, using the longest gizmo ability action required (such as activating multiple routines as a swift action). Any battery costs for routines combined this way are still used independently. This allows the crafter to place multiple AI into a single host gizmo (see Mastering Gizmos, Using Installed AI for more details about multiple AI in a single gizmo). AI you craft gain +1 skill rank per gizmo level. Your AI classifications that would gain tasks gain an additional 2 tasks, +1 additional task per 4 ranks in the associated skill. In addition, the action required to command an AI is reduced by 1 step (from move to swift). Note: An AI with 3 or more Intelligence does not need to be commanded and can act independently, but its actions may be overridden if the crafter commands it. Modification: Multifunctional Modifications: Whenever you craft a modification with multiple potential options determined at the time of its creation, you can craft it with 2 options, +1 option per 10 gizmo levels. The user may switch between chosen options as a standard action (effectively deactivating one option and activating the other); if a battery use ability was active upon switching, its remaining battery use duration is shared with the new option (if it is the same battery use ability).

When you craft a gizmo (excluding batteries), you can craft it with a number of security measures as well as a means to bypass these security measures (a bypass, such as a code, physical input, etc.). A creature may be instructed (and told about) the bypass, and how to change or deactivate the bypass, as part of instructing the creature how to use the gizmo (see Section 1.1: Introduction and Sphere Basics, Using Gizmos). A creature which has been taught the security bypass may use the gizmo normally. A creature without a gizmos security bypass treats a gizmos effective gizmo level as being 3 lower, -1 per 2 gizmo levels (to a minimum of gizmo level 1) when using that gizmo. A creature without the security bypass may attempt a proficiency check DC +10 to use the gizmo without penalty as part of activating the gizmo (or as a standard action while the gizmo is active). One or more gizmos countermeasures can be set to trigger whenever a creature without a security bypass would activate or use the gizmo (without having succeeded on a proficiency check). When a countermeasure is triggered, it remains in effect (if it would have a duration) or becomes expended until the gizmo is either activated by the crafter, a user that possesses the security bypass, or when the crafter maintains their gizmos. A user can intentionally trigger a gizmos countermeasures as a swift action. The following countermeasures can be granted to a gizmo: Special - Arsenal Set: If you possess the Arsenal Set talent, this damage can instead be any type of damage you could select with an elemental infuser. Special - (Transmission) Package: The gizmo may trigger a trap within its signal range (rather than being limited to adjacency). Countermeasures can also be granted to routines (activating the countermeasure if the routine is used without a security bypass). Regardless of the number of countermeasures in a single round, a creature can only take a total amount of damage from triggered countermeasures up to 10 per rank in the associated skill (i.e. a total of 130 damage with 13 ranks in the associated skill). Countermeasures are treated as complex mechanical traps (Disable Device DC 25 + 1 gizmo level). A countermeasure can be individually disabled, but disabling the countermeasure does not disable the security measure. A disabled countermeasure is treated as a depleted gizmo and can be restored whenever the crafter would maintain their gizmos. Failing to disable a countermeasure triggers every associated countermeasure. Abilities that would warn a creature about a trap or similar hazard may warn a creature about a countermeasure (such abilities normally grant a Perception check to notice the hazard; the Perception DC to notice a countermeasure is equal to its Disable Device DC)."

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You learn the ways of modifying armor and shields to a higher standard of defense. Modification: Armor Donner (gizmo): This modification is attached to armor. The attached armor may be compressed (or expanded back to its normal size) as a swift action. Compressed items are rendered non-functional and reduced by 1 size category (but does not weigh less), plus 1 additional size category smaller for every 5 gizmo levels (minimum Diminutive). Worn armor is automatically removed from the user if donned. The user can don compressed armor as part of the action to expand it back to its normal size (the swift action to use the armor donner). An armor donner allows the user to treat the attached armor as being 1 category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations (to a minimum of light armor; such as treating full plate armor as though it were medium armor). This decreased effective armor category does not apply to any proficiency required to use the armor. Modification: Augmented Armor (gizmo): This modification is attached to armor. The user treats the attached armor as weightless for the purposes of carrying capacity. In addition, augmentations can be equipped to the armor, and the user may benefit from these augmentations; for prosthetics, the user must still have an appropriate body part or limb to benefit from the prosthetic (i.e. leg prosthetics requiring the user have legs). Modification: Padded Protection (gizmo): This modification is attached to armor or shields. This modification amplifies a suit of armor or shields ability to protect its user against attacks it normally could not. The user adds 1/2 the attached equipments bonus to AC (minimum 1) as a circumstance bonus to their AC against attacks that bypass the attached equipments bonus to AC (such as a touch attack or the Pinpoint Targeting feat bypassing a suit of armors AC bonus). This modifications benefits do not apply if the user could already apply the attached equipments AC bonus against the attack (such as being able to apply their full shield bonus to AC against touch attacks). As an immediate action, whenever the user would be subject to an attack that would bypass the attached objects bonus to AC, the user gains a circumstance bonus to their AC against that attack equal to +2, +1 per 4 gizmo levels. The user must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed to use this ability; this ability must be used before the attack roll is made. Modification: Pliable Armor (gizmo): This modification is attached to armor or shields. This modification reduces the attached equipments armor check penalty and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC each by 1 (this cannot reduce armor check penalty below 0)."

        "arsenal set (gizmo)": {
            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You learn to craft combat-ready equipment quickly and easily. Arsenal Gizmo (gizmo, minor): You can craft a gizmo version of any basic ammunition, armor, shield, or weapon (not including alchemical or technological items, siege weapons, or other equipment outside of the settings availability subject to GM discretion). The arsenal gizmo uses the statistics (hit points, hardness, etc.) of a normal item of its kind and its material is considered ordinary for an item of its kind (i.e. an iron dagger, etc.). An arsenal gizmo is treated as a masterwork item of its kind (masterwork weapon, armor, shield, etc.). An arsenal gizmo does not need to be active to be used as an item of its kind. An arsenal gizmo does not grant its user proficiency. If crafting ammunition or thrown weapons, 50 pieces of ammunition are treated as a single weapon, and 10 identical thrown weapons are treated as crafting a single weapon. As part of crafting an arsenal gizmo, you must have studied a pre-existing version of the resulting item (usually 1 hour) to have sufficient knowledge to craft one as an arsenal gizmo. Knowledge of a specific type of armor, shield, or weapon is subject to GM discretion. At GM discretion, unique or unusual items may require a successful Craft check equal to the resulting items normal Craft DC (and may attempt an associated skill check in place of this Craft check). Note - Setting Appropriate Equipment: This talent allows a character to craft what is normal and available to the character in the setting. For example, If certain categories of weapons are not in the setting, or are otherwise not invented or only owned by limited individuals, a character may not be able to craft one (such as unusually exotic weapons or firearms, being the primary examples). For instance, a setting with emerging firearms may have early firearms, but would not have advanced or modern firearms. The Expanded Arsenal legendary talent accommodates higher-end equipment. Augmentation: Prosthetic Arsenal: Your storage capacity secondary function may store weapons or shields up to one size larger than the storage capacitys normal limitation (matching the creatures size when inside an arm/leg, 1 size smaller in a head/tail, or 2 sizes smaller in miscellany prosthetics). A weapon or shield may be attached or detached from the prosthetic with 1 minute of work (the attached equipment). The attached equipment may be withdrawn or stored from the storage capacity secondary function normally and way may be wielded as though the prosthetic provided an additional hand, such as a blade attached to an arm could still be used to hold and manipulate objects (including other weapons) while threatening and attacking with the attached blade, or a blade attached to a leg could still be walked on normally. The attached equipment cannot be disarmed while attached to the prosthetic and if the attached equipment would require more than one hand to use, the user must use an additional hand (other than the prosthetic). Attached equipment used this way does not grant the user extra attacks. Multiple weapons or shields may be attached to the prosthetic this way (up to the storage capacitys normal maximum storage) but only a single attached equipment may be in use; attached equipment may be switched with another piece of attached equipment as part of the immediate action to store an object into the prosthetic. Computation: Targeting Routine (gizmo, routine): A targeting routine routine grants no benefits unless its battery use ability is activated. Special: If the user possesses the Scout sphere scout ability, the slayers studied target ability, or the investigators studied combat ability (or other similar ability, subject to GM discretion), this routines battery use ability can be activated as part of that other abilitys use (provided the ability requires the user spend at least a swift action). If the users ability would target multiple creatures, the routine only grants its benefits against a single target. The targeting routine may be used alongside other similar abilities at GM discretion (such as a cavaliers challenge or paladins smite evil). Modification: Elemental Infuser: You may craft a versatile weapon gizmo as an advanced minor gizmo (referred to herein as an elemental infuser), granting it the following effect and battery use ability (in addition to its normal effects):"

Modification: Improved Familiar Arsenal: Your familiar arsenal modification grants the user an additional +2 circumstance bonus, +1 per 7 gizmo levels, based on the attached object. Transmission: Tracking Device (gizmo, minor): You may craft a tracking device transmitter that constantly produces a signal. Gizmos capable of receiving a tracking devices signal returns the following information: (1) type of gizmo, (2) relative direction of the gizmo from the detector. A creature in possession of a gizmo receiving a tracking devices signal may ignore any concealment a tracked creature or object is benefiting from (as though pinpointing them with a detector). Tracking devices can be attached to creatures or objects with a successful melee or ranged touch attack or by applying the tracking device to a weapon (and the tracking device attaching to the first target struck). A tracking device can be removed from a creature or object as a move action or requiring a melee touch attack if the target is not willing. Special - Infiltration Set: If you possess the Infiltration Set talent, tracking devices you craft can be made difficult to notice (unless your Tinker tradition would prevent stealth). Tracking device gizmos require a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + gizmo level + the gizmos practitioner modifier or they remain unnoticed. Bonuses to Perception to notice traps apply to a Perception DC to notice a hidden tracking device. If a tracking device is placed onto another creature using Sleight of Hand, use the higher of the two Perception DCs to notice. Transportation: You learn to craft mechanoids with the following upgrades: Special: When granting a mechanoid the armor slot or arsenal slot upgrades, you may instead provide a suit of armor, shield, or weapon not crafted with the arsenal gizmo talent (such as a preexisting magic sword, etc.). Equipment provided this way does not automatically resized to fit the mechanoid."

        "aviation set (gizmo)": {
            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You learn methods for flying and navigating in the air. Glider (gizmo, minor): A glider gizmo can be attached to a creature or armor (as though attaching a modification) and can be activated or deactivated as an immediate action. The user gains a glide speed of 30 feet, +10 feet per 3 gizmo levels. A glide speed allows the user to take no damage when falling and, when falling, may glide, moving horizontally with their glide speed, but falling 1 foot for every 5 feet traveled. The user falls a minimum of 5 feet per round, regardless of the users movement, and cannot hover using this glide speed. This glide speed is treated as a fly speed with average maneuverability; the user may be subject to strong wind or other effects while a glider is active (even if not in the air). Lifter (gizmo, minor): This gizmo lifts or lowers an attached target up or down through the air. A lifter is activated as part of attaching it to a target as a standard action, and can lift either an object or willing creature no larger than size Small, increasing by 1 size category per 3 gizmo levels (Small > Medium > Large, etc.). A lifter can be detached from a willing attached target as a move or standard action (or otherwise removed as a standard action with a successful Disable Device check against the lifters gizmo DC, sundering the lifter, etc.). Lifters have different types that determine their speed and gizmo effect duration (see Table: Lifter Type). Once activated, the attached object floats directly upward or downward a set distance and remains at that elevation for a set duration. Distance and duration are determined by the user when the lifter is activated. A lifter cannot elevate an attached creature or object more than 5 times its movement speed above the ground and cannot have its set duration be longer than its maximum duration. While airborne, an attached target can be moved by other effects while in the air (such as strong wind). If a lifter would lift a group of creatures and objects (such as a creature sitting on a chair, or a group of adventurers standing on a door as a makeshift platform), determine the objects total size beginning with the largest object and adding each other object as though it were 1 size category smaller (see Note - Abstracting Weight and Size for more). Note: Abstracting Weight and Size: The lifter gizmo can be difficult to adjudicate when a creature may have many objects in their possession or try to hold onto other objects. If determining the total size of the object based on object size, determine the objects total size beginning with the largest object and adding each other object as though it were 1 size category smaller. For example, a Medium chair and a Medium creature would be treated as 1 Medium and 1 Small object, requiring a lifter capable of size Large. A Small chair with 4 Small creatures clinging to it would effectively be 3 Small objects (1 Small, 4 Tiny), or effectively 1.5 Medium objects and also require a lifter capable of size Large. Rather than use a weight limitation, GMs are encouraged to abstract creature and object weight as their general bulk. An unencumbered creature is generally treated as a creature of their own size (such as a halfling and their worn things, their backpack, etc.). Treat a bundle of objects as the total space that bundle occupies (such as a sack full of things being a Small or Medium object despite being filled with dozens of forks). If a GM and their table prefer to use weight, a lifter gizmo can lift 25 lbs., multiplied by 5 per additional size category the lifter could accommodate greater than Small (1x Small > 5x Medium > 25x Large, etc.). Augmentation: Personal Aviation (gizmo) (requires 5 ranks in Associated Skill): A personal aviation gizmo grants no benefits unless its battery use ability is activated. Unlike a normal lifter gizmo, a personal aviation gizmo grants the user greater control over the lifters movement (not being limited to up or down, no maximum elevation limitations, etc.). The speed, maneuverability, and gizmo duration of a personal aviation gizmo are determined by the type of lifter (determined when crafted; see Table: Lifter Type). Augmentation: Wing Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): You can craft a prosthetic wing; a prosthetic wing is treated as an arm prosthetic for other abilities and effects (such as secondary functions). A wing prosthetic may be crafted as a single prosthetic or matching set. Computation: Air Superiority (gizmo, routine): This routine enhances the user's combat performance in the air. The user gains a +2 insight bonus on Fly checks, increasing by +1 per 4 gizmo levels. Modification: Targeted Lifter (gizmo): This modification is attached to manufactured weapons or may be used as a thrown weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet. As part of an attack action or sunder combat maneuver, the targeted lifter is attached to the target and the targeted lifter becomes activated. Once attached to a target this way, a targeted lifter functions as a normal lifter gizmo (moving the target upward or downward, chosen when activated). A creature can attempt a Reflex save or Escape Artist check as a move action to detach the modification from themselves or an object in their possession. An attached creature treats the targeted lifter as an unattended object when rolling a sunder combat maneuver against it.

Augmentation: Mental Augmentation (gizmo): A mental augmentation functions as a physical augmentation (from the base (augmentation) package), except the crafter assigns the augmentations ability score to a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). Augmentation & Computation: Brain Jack: Whenever you craft a mental augmentation gizmo, you may choose to allow the mental augmentation gizmo to store information. A mental augmentation gizmo improved this way gains a storage routine that does not count against the crafters maintained gizmos. The mental augmentation gizmos user can access the storage routines functions with purely mental actions (as though the mental augmentation had display and input accommodations). In addition, the mental augmentation gizmos user can record their memories into any installed storage routines. Treat stored memory as though it were video for the purposes of information storage, as well as viewing, transferring, etc. Computation: Translator (gizmo, routine): A translator routine is crafted knowing any language you can read, write, or speak fluently, and may store up to 2 languages + 1 language per 2 gizmo levels. The translator can translate the entirety of a designated written text between any languages it knows. As a standard action, the user may designate written text within 10 feet of the host gizmo (or the host gizmos signal range, if it possesses one). Languages known by a translator can be transferred to other translators at a rate of 1 minute per language; if the two translators were built by Tinker practitioners with different Tinker sphere traditions, this may also require a successful proficiency check (subject to GM discretion). A language stored by a translator may also be placed in a storage routine, treating the languages fluency as a number of pages equal to the required amount of text to gain that level of fluency (see Table: Translator Fluency). A translator can be trained to learn new languages. A gizmo with a translator next to or near (usually within 10 feet) a source of written language it does not already know automatically begins to gain fluency in that language at a rate of 1 page of text per minute (see Table: Translator Fluency for the required amount of text to gain fluency in a language). When gaining fluency in a new language, if the translator processes teaching-quality information from a linguistic guide, speech teacher, or other similar high-quality example of the language, the translator treats that information as being 10 times the amount of progress towards fluency in that language (every 1 page of teaching-quality text is 10 pages, every minute of teaching-quality speech is 10 minutes, etc.). Special - Sensory Set: If you possess the Sensory Set talent, a translator routine can instantly translate speech of a language it knows into any other language it knows upon recording that speech. A translator routine with a means of recording audio information (such as a microphone from the Sensory Set talent) can gain fluency from speech. If the translators host gizmo has a way to display or repeat back information (such as a display and input accommodation, audibly repeated to the user with a playback device, and so on), the translator can translate for the user in real-time (allowing them to understand the spoken language, as though they knew the language)."

A portable wall gizmo is crafted as one option from Table: Portable Wall, determining the physical properties of the portable wall. A portable wall cannot be expanded inside of a creatures space. Once expanded, a portable wall gizmo can be collapsed and made portable again with 1 minute of work (but requires knowledge of how to set up and disassemble the portable wall or a successful proficiency check). An expanded portable wall is damaged and destroyed as an unattended object, and once destroyed, no longer impedes movement, line of sight, or line of effect. If a portable wall would occupy multiple spaces (i.e. an advanced portable wall), each 5-feet by 5-feet edge is damaged and destroyed individually.

Instead of the dodge bonus to AC granted by the defensive fighting action, the user gains DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 this augmentations gizmo level (minimum 1) until the start of their next turn; if this damage reduction was granted as part of taking the total defense action, the user instead gains DR/adamantine equal to this augmentations gizmo level. Computation: Resistance Routine (gizmo, minor, routine): This routine provides a gizmo protection against harmful outside effects. While this routine is installed in a gizmo, the gizmo gains a +1 insight bonus to all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 gizmo levels.

            "benefit": "You learn to craft gizmos which disrupt and interfere with their targets. Disruptor (gizmo): A disruptor gizmo is crafted to inflict various effects and status conditions. A disruptor is used as a standard action, making a melee or ranged touch attack (with a range of close) which inflicts the chosen effects on a successful attack. If the effect would persist for more than 1 round, an affected creature may attempt a new saving throw against the disruptors effects once per round as a standard action (even if they could not normally take a standard action). You may craft a disruptor with one of the following disruptor effects: Augmentation: Disruptor Harness (gizmo): A disruptor harness is crafted the same as a disruptor gizmo (selecting an option as normal). Whenever the user is hit by a melee attack, as an immediate action the user may activate the disruptor harness to target the attacking creature (making a melee or ranged touch attack roll as normal). Using the disruptor harness this way deactivates it for 1d4 rounds, after which it reactivates. Modification: Disruptor Add-On (gizmo): This modification is attached to a weapon. A disruptor add-on is crafted the same as a disruptor gizmo (selecting an option as normal). As a special attack action, the user may use the disruptor as part of making an attack with the attached weapon. On a successful hit, the disruptors effects are also applied to the target (as though the target was also struck by the disruptor, attempting a saving throw as normal, etc.). Transmission: Infrasonic Generator (gizmo): This transmitter generates an infrasonic sound-based signal (with a range equal to your detector gizmos standard range, normally close range). Living creatures that enter or begin their turn in the area have their sense of spatial awareness damaged for 1 minute (Fortitude negates). A creature that fails its Fortitude save suffers a -2 penalty to their AC and CMD against all attacks of opportunity, as well as to any skill checks to avoid attacks of opportunity (such as Acrobatics checks to move through threatened spaces). This penalty increases by +1 for every 4 gizmo levels. Deaf creatures gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against this gizmos effect; a creature that successfully saves against this gizmos effect is immune for 1 minute. Animals, vermin, and creatures with sensitive hearing receive a -4 penalty to their saving throw against any effects created by this gizmo. Animals and vermin will instinctively avoid the transmitters signal. A trained animal or similar creature must be forced to enter the transmitters signal area with a Handle Animal check (DC 20 + the gizmos level). Transmission: Remote Disabling: A detector you craft can be granted the ability to remotely disrupt other technological items within its signal range. You may use the detector to perform Disable Device checks against gizmos (or other technological targets subject to being disabled with Disable Device) as though you were in physical contact with that gizmo. Your detectors signal must be able to reach the target uninterrupted during a Disable Device check made this way (i.e. if the object would be moved outside the signals radius at any point, the Disable Device check fails).

Climate Controller (gizmo, minor): A climate controller allows the user to be comfortable even in extreme cold or heat (generally between -50 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit/-45 to 60 degrees Celcius). Emergency Breather (gizmo, minor): An emergency breather grants its user a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against inhaled effects (such as inhaled poisons, contaminants, etc.), +1 per 7 gizmo levels. Fire Extinguisher (gizmo, minor): Fire extinguishers can be activated as a standard action. When a fire extinguisher is activated, it creates a 15-foot cone of misty vapor, fire suppressing chemicals, or other substances which quickly extinguishes nonmagical fires within the area of effect (as an instantaneous effect). This area of effect is a spread and can pass through open cracks and other incomplete barriers (similar to a fog cloud spell effect). The user may deplete the fire extinguisher to significantly increase its output for a single activation. Creatures with the fire subtype take 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 gizmo levels (minimum 1d6) (Reflex half) and magical fire effects within the area are subject to a dispel check (substituting the fire extinguishers gizmo level in place of caster level). Continual magic fire effects (such as a flaming weapon, summoned fire creature, or other effect subject to GM discretion) are suppressed for 1 minute. A fire extinguisher can be used to extinguish an instantaneous fire effect (such as a dragons breath weapon or a fireball spell) by readying an action to extinguish the affected area (or the creator of the effect), attempting a dispel check if required. Flashlight (gizmo, minor): The flashlight creates a beam of light in a 60-foot cone, 120-foot line or 30-foot radius area, increasing the light level in the affected area to be bright light and increasing the light level beyond this initial area by one step, in a 120-foot cone, 240-foot line or 60-foot radius (such as increasing the further area from darkness to dim light). When activated as a cone or line, the user must choose the cone or lines direction and may reorient it as a free action once per round. When crafting a flashlight, you may choose to have it create basic white light or any other color of your choice. The user may deplete the flashlight to significantly increase its output for a single activation (or as part of activating the flashlight as a standard action). The flashlights output is increased to produce a far more powerful burst of light causing creatures within the flashlights area to be blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates) and dazzled for 1d4 rounds; the user may exclude themselves from this effect. If a creature with light sensitivity or vulnerability to bright light or sunlight is within the area of effect, they are instead blinded for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude negates) and dazzled for 1 minute. This burst of light can blind constructs, undead, and other creatures normally immune to Fortitude saving throws that could not affect objects so long as that creature has regular sight. If this flashlights area would overlap with a magical darkness effect when activated this way, the magical darkness effect is subject to a dispel check (substituting gizmo level in place of caster level). Purifier (gizmo, minor): A purifier cleans and purifies a wide number of substances. A purifier can be used as a standard action to purify up to 15-foot cube of organic material (liquids, food, etc.; but not living creatures), removing any non-magical diseases, poisons, and other contaminants. Acidic or basic substances are neutralized into clean, pure water. Special: Purifiers gain additional functionality if you possess the following talents: Transmission: Distress Signal: Transmitters you craft can broadcast a distress signal, determined when crafted. A distress signal can be activated as a full-round action; once activated, the transmitter broadcasts constantly until deactivated with another full-round action. A gizmo cannot use any of its other functions while broadcasting a distress signal. A distress signals message is generic (e.g. Help Needed) unless the user succeeds at a proficiency check as part of activating the distress signal. A successful proficiency check allows the user to choose up to 5 words per gizmo level for the distress signal to communicate. Distress signals are easier to detect and have a range of 5 miles, +1 per gizmo level. Any gizmo receiving a distress signal can display the distress signals message and allows the receiving devices user to track the source of the distress signal. Tracking the distress signals source requires a successful proficiency check or a Survival check (DC 10 + 1 per mile the distress signal traveled). A successful check informs the user of the relative distance to and direction of the distress signals source. Transportation: You learn to craft mechanoids with the following upgrades: Emergency Vehicle (upgrade): The mechanoid is crafted with each minor gizmo granted by this talent as an innate gizmo, +1 additional minor gizmo (of the crafters choice) per 2 gizmo levels (such as a second flashlight or emergency breather, etc.). Innate gizmos granted by this upgrade can be activated and used by creatures adjacent to the mechanoid (such as a creature using an innate emergency breather belonging to a mechanoid designed for fire rescue)."

            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You learn to craft gizmos that can generate power and assist with energy management and distribution. Energy Cables (gizmo, project): Energy cables allow for long distance transfers of energy. Every 10 feet of energy cable requires 1 gp of project material; longer cables may be constructed by paying the appropriate cost (such as 5 gp of project material for a single 50-foot cable). An energy cable can be attached or detached to an unattended gizmo within the users reach as a swift action. An energy cable can be connected to other energy cables, and connecting gizmos to an energy cable does not need to be done at the cables end points (such as attaching a gizmo to a midpoint of the energy cable). Gizmos attached to the ends of the energy cable cannot move further than the energy cables total length and the energy cable must be able to occupy all the spaces it passes through (such as bending around corners, threaded through holes, etc.). If two gizmos connected by an energy cable would be moved further apart from each other than the energy cables length, they must first be disconnected from the cable or the energy cable must be broken. Any gizmo attached to an energy cable treats any batteries attached to the energy cable as being attached to them and can use those batteries to power their functions (similar to a power pack). Power Pack (gizmo, minor): This gizmo is a container for battery gizmo storage while also allowing stored batteries to be used more easily. A power pack consists of a section to attach batteries and a series of cables that can be attached to other gizmos. The user can don/remove a power pack as a standard action, and can attach/detach the cables to other gizmos in their possession as a free action, even outside of their turn. This connection is very weak however, and if the gizmo ever leaves the user's possession, the power packs cables automatically detach. A gizmo attached to the power pack with one of its cables treats batteries attached to the power pack as if they were attached. This does not allow a single battery to be used by multiple gizmos. If a gizmo is detached while depleting a battery stored in the power pack, the gizmos effects end and the battery is depleted. Special - Power Plant: If a power pack gizmo is attached to a power plant, the batteries crafted by the power plant are automatically attached to the power pack (if there are multiple power packs, the power plant will evenly attach batteries between the available power packs). Power Plant (gizmo, project): This gizmo creates batteries. Each power plant requires an engineering kit as an additional component, which cannot be removed without first disassembling the power plant. A power plant crafts batteries at a set rate, has a maximum number of batteries they can craft in a 24-hour period, and a maximum number of batteries they can have crafted at any given time. Batteries generated by a power plant do not count towards your gizmo limit. Power plants will naturally stop crafting batteries once they reach their daily limit (or maximum crafted). Alternatively, a power plant may be activated to recharge depleted batteries. The user may place a number of batteries equal to 5 times the power plants speed, recharging the batteries in 1 minute (as opposed to the 15 normally required to craft or maintain batteries). Recharging batteries counts against the power plants craft limit for that day."

            "benefit": "Speed: This is the number of batteries the plant produces every hour. Limit: This is the power plant's limit for how many batteries it can produce in a 24 hour period. This limit increases by the listed rate for every 5 gizmo levels the power plant possesses. Maximum: This is the power plants limit for how many batteries it can maintain independently. Ranks: This is the minimum number of ranks you must possess before you can craft a power plant of that size. In addition, the power plant itself must be constructed with a minimum gizmo level equal to this rank in order to be functional. Cost: This is the power plant's project material cost in gp per gizmo level. Power plants deactivate if made smaller than their original size (such as by a size altering effect) and cannot be activated until returned to their normal size. This includes any power plants made as innate gizmos for mechanoids. You may only maintain one power plant at a given time. Transmission: Signal Cables: While your energy cables are attached to a transmitter or other gizmo capable of generating a signal, all gizmos attached to that energy cable are treated as being within the transmitters signal range (regardless of distance, intervening materials, etc.).

            "benefit": "You learn methods of excavation, including rock and dirt as well as liquids and gas, as well as developing more advanced means of excavation and coordinating civil engineering. Personal Excavator (gizmo, minor): This gizmo takes the form of digging equipment which improves the users ability to dig and excavate materials. The user can spend 1 minute to move up to 15-foot cube, +15-foot cube per 4 gizmo levels of dirt, sand, and loose soil (or similar materials where a shovel would be appropriate, subject to GM discretion) to an unoccupied and empty space within the users reach. For every size category larger than Medium the user is, the total material the user can move is doubled (or halved, for each size category smaller than Medium). This gizmo cannot be used to create tunnels, but can otherwise be used to create short mounds, create trenches, etc. Pipe (gizmo, project): You may craft pipes, troughs, tubes, or other similar constructions to move substances. Every 5 feet of pipe requires 5 gp of project material. Gathered project materials can be allocated towards multiple sets of pipes, as though they were a single project. A pipe gizmo may be crafted as thin as desired or up to 5 feet wide, or may be comprised of multiple pipes for larger pipes (such as a 10-foot diameter pipe would consist of 4 cubes of pipe, costing 4 gp per 5 feet). A pipe does not need to be a proper pipe, and could be an open track, trough, etc. Substances loaded into pipes do not move on their own. Special - (Transportation) Package: If you possess the (transportation) package, 5 feet of pipe may be constructed with 5 gp of project material to be capable of moving substances loaded onto them while active (as a conveyor belt, or similar) up to 5 feet per round, +5 feet per 10 gizmo levels; if during combat, this movement occurs at initiative 0 (the end of the round). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Pump (gizmo): You may craft a handheld pump capable of manipulating gases and liquids and compressing them into a small area. As a standard action, the pump can be used to inhale an adjacent gas (such as smoke, mist, etc.) or liquid, inhaling 15-foot cube of liquid or gas per gizmo level. If using the pump to inhale multiple 5-foot cubes of a substance, each cube must be adjacent and contiguous (such as a single fog cloud, body of water, etc.). Substances that would normally damage a gizmo still damage the pump (such as corrosive acids, lava, etc.). Any inhaled substance is stored in the pumps storage container; if the storage container is full, the substance is not inhaled. Alternatively, a pump may inhale substances and deposit them into an attached pipe. If there is no storage container or pipe, the substance is deposited in the users square. As a standard action, the pump may exhale a single storage containers substances to deposit them into an adjacent square. Liquid and gas will naturally spread from that square. If attempting to pour a storage containers substance directly onto another creature, the user must make a successful melee touch attack (otherwise the creature avoids being drenched in the substance, but may still be standing within it depending on what was exhaled). The user may partially exhale a storage container this way (in 5-foot cube increments). The pump gizmo may also be used against creatures by leveraging its powerful suction, or exhalation. The user gains a circumstance bonus on bull rush and drag combat maneuvers made with the pump equal to 1/2 this gizmos level (minimum 1) + this gizmos practitioner modifier; a bull rush or drag combat maneuver performed using the pump does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Storage Container (gizmo, minor): A storage container is a gizmo that can contain 15-foot cube of liquid or gas per gizmo level. Materials compressed in a storage container weigh the same, but occupy the much smaller space. If a stored liquid or gas has a duration, its duration is not suspended while stored in the container. A storage container may be emptied as a standard action, or will empty if broken or exhaled through a pump gizmo. Storage containers are attached or detached from a pump as though they were a battery gizmo. Augmentation: Burrower (gizmo): A burrower grants no benefits unless its battery use ability is activated. Computation: Ground Superiority (gizmo, routine): This routine enhances the users combat performance on the ground. The user gains a +2 insight bonus to their CMD against bull rush, drag, reposition, overrun, and trip combat maneuvers, increasing by +1 per 4 gizmo levels. Modification: Fracture Adapter (gizmo): This modification is attached to a weapon. Attacks made with the attached weapon ignore 1 point of damage reduction or hardness per 2 gizmo levels (minimum 1). These benefits are halved (minimum 1) when applied to damage reduction that cannot be overcome (e.g. DR 5/). Modification: Killer Drill (gizmo): This modification is attached to a melee weapon. The attached weapon grants the user a +1 circumstance bonus on sunder combat maneuvers and on Strength checks made to break objects performed with the attached weapon, +1 per 4 gizmo levels. In addition, whenever the user successfully sunders an object with the attached weapon, the object loses an additional 1 hit point per gizmo level (this additional hit point loss is added to the damage dealt by the sunder maneuver and reduced by hardness as appropriate). This effect is otherwise not damage for the purposes of other effects based on damaging objects (i.e. Greater Sunder or the blacksmiths thunderous blows class feature allowing damage dealt to an object to spill over to the objects wearer or wielder, etc.).

Mobility Gear (gizmo): A mobility gear gizmo grants each of the following movement modes: Augmentation: Aerobic Enhancer: A physical augmentation assigned to Constitution grants its bonus Constitution score when determining how long the user can run or hold their breath; the aerobic enhancers effective bonus to the users Constitution score increases by an additional +2 per 5 gizmo levels. In addition, the user is always treated as being acclimated to any altitude they are in (see the mountain travel rules, Pathfinder Core Rulebook). In addition, an aerobic enhancer gains the following battery use: Augmentation: Nightvision (gizmo): The user gains low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 20 feet. Computation: Guidance Positioning System (gizmo, routine): This routine (called a GPS for short) allows its user to quickly map their surrounding environment. As a standard action, the user can produce a 3-dimensional map of everything they have line of sight to. A map produced this way is in color and does not provide any additional information about the environment. The users location is tracked and visible on the map generated by the GPS with a visible indicator (such as seeing where on a length mountain trail you are located, if you mapped the mountain trail with a GPS). A map produced by a GPS routine can be stored inside of a storage routine, treating 1 cubic mile of information as 1 hour of video for the purposes of storage. The user or another creature observing the map may attempt a Knowledge (geography), Survival, and other appropriate skill checks (subject to GM discretion) about information displayed on the map. A creature using this map to attempt a Knowledge (geography), Survival, or other appropriate skill check gains a +2 insight bonus to that check, +1 per 2 gizmo levels. If a GPS is built with a gizmo containing the ability to generate a signal, the GPS gains the following battery use: Modification: Environmental Equalizer (gizmo, minor): This modification is attached to any equipment. The attached equipment can function underwater or in a vacuum without any of the normal limitations or penalties to its function due to those conditions (such as ignoring the penalties for underwater combat with a bludgeoning weapon, firing a ranged weapon underwater, or drinking a potion underwater). The attached equipment (and its ammunition, if any) reduces weapon attack roll penalties when in areas of high wind or other environmental factors by 1/2 (such as heavy fog, but does not bypass or reduce environmental conditions that make ranged attacks impossible). Modification: Sheltering Armor (gizmo): This modification is attached to manufactured armor. The attached armor grants the user a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws made against environmental effects (such as weather exposure, inhaled effects, exposure to contamination, etc.), +1 per 4 gizmo levels. The sheltering armor modification accommodates a specific type of creature (such as an air breathing creature, water-breathing creature), chosen when crafted. Transmission: Locator Chips: Transmitters you craft may constantly broadcast their location; this signal may be enabled or disabled as a swift action. A gizmo receiving this signal informs its user of the relative distance and direction of the transmitter. This information is sufficient to inform the user of other gizmos within signal range (such as using a communicator to send a message to the user of the locator chipped gizmo). Special - (Computation) Package: When crafting a gizmo with a transmitter (such as the communicator accommodation), you may specify additional data to be broadcast by their locator chip ability (such as keywords or a name, colors for a visual display, and other identifying information). Transportation: Environmental Cabin: You improve the enclosure upgrade. While the environmental cabin is closed (and is granting total cover to its passengers), the passengers are protected from environmental effects as though they were benefiting from the sheltering armor modification with its additional function active (granted by the Exploration talent). Just like when creating a sheltering armor modification, you must choose the type of breathable environment when granting this upgrade to a mechanoid (such as air-breathing, aquatic, etc.). An environmental cabin can be crafted with an airlock (creating a protected and an unprotected section of the mechanoid) allowing a creature to enter the mechanoid without compromising the protected section. Entering and moving through an airlock requires the same action as entering an enclosure (normally a move action). Creating an opening from a closed interior to the exterior (such as opening a latch or opening the airlock while the environment is not stabilized) compromises the protected environment and suppresses any benefits it grants. An environmental cabin restores the protected environment to the interior after being closed for 1 minute."

        "grappling hook (gizmo)": {
            "prerequisite": "",
            "benefit": "You can craft powerful grappling hooks and other similar technology. This talent makes extensive use of the Tethered Combat rules (see Section 1.1: Introduction & Sphere Basics, Tethered Combat for more). Grappling Hook (gizmo): This grappling hook is connected to an automatic winch by a strong cable. Section 1.1: Introduction & Sphere Basics, Tethered Combat for basic information on using a grappling hook. This talent lists additional information unique to the grappling hook gizmo. A grappling hook gizmo has a cord length up to medium range (but can be crafted with a shorter cable length) and has a removal DC equal to its Break DC. A grappling hooks user (or a creature in control of the winch) can detach the hook from a tethered target as a free action, and while detached, may partially or fully retract the grappling hook as a free action. The grappling hooks winch can also be crafted to function as a second grappling hook, and may be thrown separately (or as part of throwing the grappling hook); the winch may optionally be crafted to just be a grappling hook (and have no way for a user to manually retract it) - this is usually useful when using grappling hook gizmos to hook two targets together. A grappling hook gizmo has a range increment of 20 feet (with a maximum number of range increments equal to the cables total length divided by this increment; i.e. 8 increments for a 160-foot long cable). If the grappling hooks winch was also crafted as a grappling hook, the winch may be thrown as part of throwing or attaching the grappling hook. When throwing both the grappling hook and the winch at the same time, use the same attack roll to resolve both attempts. A grappling hook can support the weight of a size Large creature, +1 size category per 3 gizmo levels. If multiple grappling hooks are used to lift the same target, increase the maximum weight by 1 additional size category per additional grappling hook. While attached to a target, the user can activate the grappling hooks winch as a move action to retract the cable up to close range, moving the user toward the attached target (and retracting the cable by that length). If there is not an unobstructed path for the user to move through to reach the target, the user ends in the closest available square (such as being unable to pass through holes in the wall, closed doors, etc.); however, the user can move around corners and through obstacles (as appropriate, subject to GM discretion). The user gains a circumstance bonus on drag and reposition combat maneuver checks and Strength checks made using the grappling hook against an attached target equal to 1/2 this gizmos level (minimum 1) + this gizmos practitioner modifier; a drag or reposition combat maneuver performed using the grappling hook does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When throwing the grappling hook as part of an attack action, the user may perform a drag combat maneuver against the target to pull them closer. This may be done as part of throwing both the grappling hook and its winch; rolling the drag combat maneuver check against both targets to pull them closer (optionally retracting the grappling hooks slack); creatures that collide with one another this way take 1d6 damage per 5 feet of remaining movement. Augmentation: You learn how to craft the following secondary functions: Special - Sensory Set: When this secondary function is granted to a sensory prosthetic, the prosthetic can be extended in such a way that allows the user to determine their senses from the square their senses extend into (such as extending their eyes around a corner). Modification: Hookshot (gizmo): This modification is attached to a manufactured weapon (and not ammunition). This modification functions as a grappling hook gizmo, treating the attached weapon as the grappling hooks winch. Whenever the user makes an attack action or attack of opportunity with the attached weapon, the user may attempt to also attach the grappling hook to the target (unwinding the cable as appropriate). If successful, the grappling hook is attached to the attacked target (and the user may choose to immediately attempt a drag or reposition combat maneuver check against the target as a free action). The grappling hook must be retracted to be used again this way. If the attached weapon is a ranged weapon, the grappling hook can be fired with the weapons ammunition (i.e. an arrow with a grappling line) or can be used without expending ammunition, using the ranged weapons range increments to throw the grappling hook. Transmission: Hooked Signal: Your grappling hook gizmos can be crafted to transfer signals through their cables; a transmitter may be attached to the grappling hooks winch (as though attaching a modification). A creature or object the grappling hook is secured to is considered to be within an attached transmitters signal range regardless of intervening materials (so long as the cable is unbroken). Transmitters can be attached to a grappling hooks winch (as though attaching a battery). Transportation: You learn to craft mechanoids with the following upgrades:"

            "benefit": "You learn to craft the gizmos that assist in infiltration. Auto-Pick (gizmo): This gizmo is a series of automated hooks and levers designed to disable devices automatically. An auto-pick gizmo functions as masterwork thieves tools which may also be used on technological targets (including routines). As a standard action, the user may attach the auto-pick to a device which could be disabled by a Disable Device check, priming the auto-pick for its battery use ability. Special - Disruption Set: Your auto-pick gizmo may use the Disruption Set remote hacking ability as though it were a detector, and no longer needs to be attached to the device it is disabling. Obfuscation Kit (gizmo): This gizmo functions as a disguise kit with unlimited uses. The user can spend a standard action to disguise themselves. However, this disguise is not solid, does not allow the user to disguise themselves as another size, and interacting with it automatically reveals it to be false (such as touching something that does not exist, or viewing them with an exotic sense), though this does not automatically deactivate the projection. Effects which would see through illusions, such as true seeing, can immediately see through a disguise generated by this gizmo. The user cannot assume multiple disguises using this gizmo and assuming a disguise in front of another creature automatically reveals the nature of this disguise to that creature. Once the user is disguised, the user may suppress this gizmos disguise as a free action, or enable this disguise as a swift action. Augmentation: Hidden Inventory: The user gains a 10 + 1/2 gizmo level circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to retrieve stored items unnoticed from their storage capacity secondary function. The user may attempt Sleight of Hand checks to retrieve stored items from their storage capacity as part of retrieving the item; drawing a stored item faster than a move action this way is not treated as drawing a hidden object or weapon for the purposes of other abilities or effects. Augmentation: Trace Eraser (gizmo, minor): A trace eraser suppresses and removes particles the user leaves naturally (such as fingerprints and DNA evidence) as well as lightens their tracks. The user increases the DC to follow the users tracks by 5 + 1/2 gizmo level (or otherwise detect traces of their presence through mundane means, e.g. tracking with Survival, observation with Perception). Modification: Silencer (gizmo): This modification is attached to a weapon. Whenever the user would use the attached weapon to make ranged attacks using the Stealth skills sniping use, the user reduces the Stealth penalty to stay hidden by 1 per 2 gizmo levels (to a minimum penalty of 0). Modification: Sound Dampener (gizmo, minor): This modification can be attached to any object (such as thieves tools). The Perception DC of any sound-based checks to hear the attached object being used (such as a lock being picked) is increased by 5 + 1/2 gizmo level (except the sound of battle). Note: The standard DC to hear a key being turned in a lock is 20. GMs should treat most uses of similar tools as being a similar DC to notice. Louder tools decrease the starting DC as appropriate (for example, the sounds of using a pickaxe is easier to notice than the sounds of using a file on a metal bar).

Body Bag (gizmo, minor): A body bag gizmo is a water and air-tight container that slows the rate of decomposition and allows for storage of creatures. A body bag can fit 1 Medium-sized or smaller willing, helpless, or dead creature stored as a full-round action. A body bag can be crafted to count as more than one minor gizmo (effectively taking multiple minor gizmo slots). For each minor gizmo a body bag counts as beyond the first, the body bag can accommodate a creature 1 size larger (Large, Huge, etc.). A corpse stored in a body bag slows the passage of time and decay. While a corpse is stored, every 2 days is treated as 1 day passing for the purposes of reanimation effects (such as the raise dead spell), +1 day per 4 gizmo levels (treating every 6 days as 1 day at gizmo level 20). A body bag can only effectively preserve a single body at a time - no matter how many bodies could fit. Special - Infiltration Set: If you possess the Infiltration Set talent, a body bag that contains a creature appears to be a nondescript bag or sack. Any creature that interacts with the body bag or intentionally searches for stimuli notices nothing unusual unless it succeeds at a Perception check with a DC of 15 + gizmo level. Chemalyzer (gizmo): This gizmo functions as both an alchemy lab and a healers kit with 10 uses. When using this gizmo, the user gains a competence bonus equal to 2 +1 per 2 gizmo levels on Craft (alchemy) and Heal checks, as well as skill checks made to identify diseases, poisons, and chemical substances. In addition, the user may spend a swift action to determine if a substance in contact with this gizmo has chemical qualities (such as being a disease, poison, alchemical or manufactured substance, etc.). If the chemalyzer detects chemical qualities, the user may immediately attempt a skill check to determine its nature (such as Craft (alchemy) for a substance, Heal or Knowledge (nature) for a disease or poison, or other appropriate check subject to GM discretion). Special - (Transmission) Package: The chemalyzer is now a detector and may detect and analyze a substance within signal range (instead of contact). Health Monitor (gizmo, minor): This worn gizmo can be donned or removed as a swift action. The health monitor records and tracks whether the creature is affected by any conditions, including whether they are harmed or unharmed, have lost hit points within the previous minute, or are suffering from the bleed, confused, death, disabled, dying, staggered, or other status conditions. The monitor also shows the existence of magical effects afflicting them, noting them as anomalous or unnatural, but cannot identify them. Creatures gain a +2 insight bonus on skill checks to identify an ongoing affliction affecting the user. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 gizmo levels. Implant Expertise: You may use your bonus in the associated skill in place of your Heal skill bonus whenever you would attempt a check to implant an object, including gizmos (see Section 1.2: Skill Rules, Heal for more). This includes a check to remove a body part or organ, provided you subsequently attempt the check to replace that body part or organ with a prosthetic. If you could already attempt an associated skill check in place of a Heal check when implanting organs (such as with the Tinker Savvy talent), you receive a competence bonus on your associated skill checks made to implant objects equal to 1/2 your Hit Dice. Augmentation: Rapid Injector (gizmo): This augmentation can store 1 potion or liquid consumable, +1 liquid per 5 gizmo levels. Storing a liquid into an rapid injector gizmo takes 1 full-round action; liquids stored in an rapid injector do not need to be homogenous (such as being separated by chambers or sections, etc.). As a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the user can choose one of the stored consumables to inject into themselves, gaining the benefits of that consumable. This augmentation can be crafted to allow creatures adjacent to the user to activate this gizmo as a move action (if the user is willing or helpless; this injects one of the stored liquids into the user). Augmentation: Prosthetic Organ (gizmo, minor): You can craft prosthetic organs (excluding the brain) that either replace or support a creatures internal organs (such as a mechanical shell to protect a heart, or completely replacing a creatures nonfunctional lungs). Prosthetic organs are always implanted (see Section 1.2: Skill Rules, Heal for more). A prosthetic organ suppresses any ability damage, ability drain, or negative effect caused by an impaired or missing organ. A prosthetic organ cannot have a secondary function (unless otherwise stated). Augmentation: You learn to craft prosthetic with the following secondary functions: Computation: Health Optimizer (gizmo, routine): A health optimizer routine records and assists the user when they receive medical attention. This routine only provides benefits when installed in a health monitor. This routine records all hit point damage (lethal and nonlethal), ability damage and drain, as well as any status conditions gained or lost. This information is stored as 10 words per recorded event (i.e. individual change of hit points, status condition gained or lost) and is retained in the health monitor for up to 24 hours (and may be stored in a storage routine). Transmission: Telehealth: When you craft a health monitor, you may choose to have it constantly transmit data. Your transmitters can receive information from your health monitors, allowing the transmitters user to know the relative position of the health monitor and status of the creature at all times (as though able to read the health monitor at range).

Gathered project materials can be allocated towards multiple sets of rail tracks, as though they were a single project. A single track must be designed for one kind of rail wheel of the same size. The track may be distributed in 5-foot segments and intersections of your choice. Each 5 foot segment of track requires a minute to properly secure to or remove from a surface. When placed, rail tracks are oriented to allow for movement from one edge of the square to another (such as north to south, north to east, or even diagonally); the rail track only allows for movement along its oriented path. Rail tracks can also be secured to horizontal walls or ceilings, allowing for rail wheels to move horizontally across walls, or even vertically up walls, without requiring a Climb check or other assistance. Augmentation: Accelerator (gizmo): The user gains a +10 foot competence bonus to each mode of movement they possess (land, burrow, climb, fly, and swim), +5 feet per 5 gizmo levels. Augmentation: Rail Wheel Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): Rail wheel prosthetic is a leg prosthetic. Rail wheel prosthetic grants the user a base land speed of 60 feet, +10 feet per 2 gizmo levels, but only while moving over rails or a sufficiently grooved surface (subject to GM discretion). If being used to move on an insufficient surface, rail wheel prosthetic only grants a base land speed of 10 feet. When using rail wheels for overland travel, the rail wheels grant the user a walk speed of 30 miles an hour, +10 per 2 gizmo levels. This overland movement can only be used while traveling over rails meant for a train or reasonably similar vehicle (such as the rail track project as granted by this talent). Augmentation: Tread Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): Tread prosthetic is a leg prosthetic. Tread prosthetic grants the user a base land speed of 20 feet, +10 feet per 4 gizmo levels. When used as a primary land speed, the user ignores difficult terrain. When using treads for overland travel, the treads grant the user a walk speed of 10 miles an hour, +10 miles per 4 gizmo levels. The user ignores overland movement speed reductions caused by terrain (except for mountains and swamps). Augmentation: Wheel Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): Wheel prosthetic is a leg prosthetic. Wheel prosthetic grants the user a base land speed of 40 feet, +10 feet per 3 gizmo levels. When used as a primary land speed, the user treats each square of difficult terrain as 3 squares of movement (rather than 2). When using wheels for overland travel, the wheels grant the user a walk speed of 20 miles an hour, +10 miles per 3 gizmo levels. While using wheels, the movement penalty multiplier for trackless movement increases by an additional step (a x3/4 speed would reduce to x1/2, x1/2 to x1/4, and x1/4 to x1/8).

The pressure jack is treated as having a Strength score of 20 + 2 per 2 gizmo levels for short-term lifting or Strength checks (such as forcing open a door or lifting a heavy object). If the jack would extend a target into a solid surface, it deals 1d8 + 1d8 bludgeoning damage per 2 gizmo levels (Fortitude halves), as long as the jack is on a solid surface. If used for lifting for longer than 1 minute, it can lift a target of Large size before breaking, +1 size category per 3 gizmo levels. Targets of a smaller size can be lifted indefinitely. Multiple such gizmos can be used at once to increase the maximum size category by 1 for each jack applied. Augmentation: Load Bearer: A physical augmentation assigned to Strength grants its bonus to the user's Strength score for the purposes of carrying capacity. Augmentation: Spring Boots: A physical augmentation assigned to Dexterity allows its user to always take the minimum possible damage from falls (as if the GM had rolled a 1 on each die of damage incurred by the fall) and the user does not fall prone after taking damage due to a fall. As a move action, the user may pressurize the spring boots and build pressure; pressure cannot be built multiple times (the spring boots are either pressurized or they are not) and the spring boots depressurizes and loses pressure at the end of the users next turn. While pressurized, the user gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump equal to +10, +1 per gizmo level (in addition to the physical augmentations normal bonus to Dexterity-based skill checks).

As a standard action, the user can pressurize the attached weapon and build pressure; pressure cannot be built multiple times (the attached weapon is either pressurized or it is not) and the attached weapon depressurizes and loses pressure at the end of the users next turn. If the user makes a successful attack with the attached weapon while the attached weapon is pressurized, the user may depressurize the weapon to expend the built-up pressure and push the target 5 feet (treat this as a successful bull rush combat maneuver performed as a free action). If the target would be moved into a square that is directly harmful to them (e.g. a bed of spikes, fire, out a window, etc.), the target may attempt a Reflex save to stop moving.

Arachnid prosthetic grants the user a 20 foot land speed and a 20 foot climb speed (including the +8 racial bonus for gaining a climb speed); each movement mode increases by +10 feet per 4 gizmo levels. The user can use this climb speed without using their hands and at no penalty. The user treats each individual arachnid prosthetic as though they were two legs (instead of a single leg) for the purposes of carrying capacity and the users CMD against the trip (such as a quadruped creature, or creature with more legs). Augmentation: Aquatic Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): Aquatic prosthetic is a leg prosthetic. Aquatic prosthetic grants the user a 30 foot swim speed, +10 feet per 4 gizmo levels (including the +8 racial bonus for gaining a swim speed). Augmentation: Ophidian Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): Ophidian prosthetic is a leg prosthetic. The users legs are bound together into a snake-like torso ending in a tail; the users legs become nonfunctional and the user cannot benefit from any additional legs while using the ophidian prosthetics movement (including other prosthetics). Ophidian prosthetic grants the user a base land speed of 20 feet, +10 feet per 4 gizmo level, the user is treated as a quadruped for the purposes of carrying capacity, and cannot be tripped (but may still be knocked prone by other means).

Augmentation: Additional Secondary Function: Prosthetics you craft can have 1 additional secondary function (allowing each prosthetic you craft to have 2 secondary functions, before other sources of additional secondary functions). Augmentation: Reliable Prosthetic: When a prosthetic gizmo you craft would become depleted or destroyed, instead of losing its functionality as a limb or body part of that kind, the prosthetic continues to function as a regular limb or body part of that kind for the creature (but loses any and all additional functions as a gizmo, secondary functions, abilities, etc.). Note: This effect allows for a creature with an implanted prosthetic leg to continue to use the leg as a leg, but not for any other use or purpose. If an effect would destroy a creatures limb or body part, the prosthetic for that body part is destroyed as normal. Augmentation: Supplemental Prosthetic: You can craft any prosthetic you can craft normally as a supplemental prosthetic. Instead of replacing the users normal limbs or organs, a supplemental prosthetic grants the user additional limbs or organs (for example, a supplemental arm prosthetic would be in addition to the users existing arms, rather than replacing one). Supplemental prosthetic are inferior to a natural limb or body part, the Tinker sphere Advanced Prosthetics talent is required to make natural prosthetics (limbs and body parts with true, full functionality) (see Mastering Gizmos, Prosthetic for more). Because a supplemental prosthetic does not replace a creatures normal physiology, its functions are more limited than a normal prosthetic of its kind. Each supplemental prosthetic functions as noted in its entry (instead of as a normal body part of its kind). Supplemental prosthetics may be modified by effects that require limbs or body parts of that kind. Supplemental prosthetics never grant the user extra attacks. A supplemental prosthetics bonuses (if any) do not stack with other supplemental prosthetic of that kind (unless otherwise stated). Hiding Supplemental Prosthetic: Supplemental prosthetics can be retracted to be hidden against the users normal physical profile (such as collapsing against the body to appear flat, folding up against the users arms, etc.). A retracted prosthetic may not be used for any of its normal functions except to be extracted and usable. Retracting or extracting a supplemental prosthetic can be done as a swift action, and may be done for any number of the users supplemental prosthetics. When retracting a supplemental prosthetic, the user may attempt a Sleight of Hand check (as though hiding an object) with a 10 + 1/2 gizmo level circumstance bonus to hide the presence of the supplemental prosthetic. The effects of a prosthetic crafted as a supplemental prosthetic are as follows: Augmentation: Prosthetic Head (gizmo, prosthetic): This prosthetic grants the full utility of a head and requires being implanted (see Section 1.2: Skill Rules, Heal). The creature's existing sensory organs are transferred to the prosthetics (or can be crafted and provided separately if you possess the Sensory Set talent). Special - Medical Set: If you possess the Medical Set talent, a head prosthetic can include a new brain.

Modification: Misfire Manager (gizmo): This modification is attached to a firearm or other weapon with a misfire chance (excluding siege weapons). The attached weapons misfire value is reduced by 1, +1 per 10 gizmo levels (minimum 1). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated determining the firearms misfire value. Modification: Range Amplifier (gizmo): This modification is attached to a weapon (and not ammunition). The attached weapon increases its base range increment by +10 feet or gains the ability to be thrown with a base range increment of 10 feet (maximum 5 range increments). This range increase is applied last after any other increases to range increments. The attached weapon also gains 1 additional maximum range increment, +1 maximum range increment for every 10 gizmo levels (increasing the normal maximum number of range increments for a thrown weapon up from 5, or a projectile weapon up from 10). Modification: Speed Loader (gizmo): This modification is attached to ranged weapons (excluding siege weapons). The first time each round the user would reload the attached weapon, the time required to reload the attached weapon is reduced by 1 step (i.e., full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a free action). This reload speed reduction stacks with other sources of reload speed reduction (such as the Rapid Reload feat). Modification: Sniper Scope (gizmo): This modification is attached to a ranged weapon or siege weapon. The user reduces the total penalties caused by range increments or weather by 1 + 1 per 4 gizmo levels when using the attached weapon. In addition, attacks made with the attached weapon can benefit from battlefield position when attacking from higher ground as though it were a melee attack.

Sensory Gizmo (gizmo, minor): You learn to craft the following sensory minor gizmos: Special - (Transmission) Package: A playback system may be crafted as a transmitter and may project data onto a non-technological surface within its signal range. Sensory gizmos may be configured to play back data a certain number of times, repeat indefinitely, and so on. Augmentation: Sensory Prosthetic (gizmo, prosthetic): You can craft prosthetics for any of the 5 senses (sight, eyes; hearing, ears; smell, nose; taste, tongue; touch, haptic feedback skin or similar). Augmentation: You learn how to craft the following secondary functions: Computation: Multimedia (accommodation): As an accommodation, you may craft a gizmo with up to one of each sensory gizmo as an innate gizmo. Sensory gizmos may now be used simultaneously (such as a camera and microphone recording sound and images to create a video with sound). In addition, information recorded by a sensory gizmo can be immediately stored into an installed storage routine rather than onto the recording gizmo. Special - (Transmission) Package: A detector with this accommodation may store information it senses as a log (treating each sensed piece of information as 1 page of text) directly into an installed storage routine. The detector may be adjusted to store anything it senses immediately or require manually storing information (as a free action by the user after the detector senses something), and may also be adjusted to store other specific information (such as images or sound from a camera or microphone) as part of creating a log. Computation: Voice Controls (accommodation) (requires microphone): A gizmo with an innate microphone (such as one granted by the multimedia accommodation) may be activated or used by issuing a verbal command (similar to casting a spell); verbal commands are a chosen keyword or phrase (i.e. Computer, activate and chart a course) and must be spoken in a strong, clear voice. Issuing a voice command requires the same action to activate or use a gizmo normally; voice commands may also be used to activate a gizmo at range (normally close range, although shouting or acoustic environments may increase this subject to GM discretion). When issuing verbal commands this way, only a single gizmo may be activated or used (even if multiple would have the same verbal command). You may choose to have verbal commands only be usable by a chosen creature (or creatures, designated when crafting) to avoid unwanted creatures activating the gizmo. Modification: Sense Amplifier (gizmo): This modification is attached to any sensory assisting device (such as a normal pair of glasses or spyglass, a hearing aid or eavesdropping device, or an equivalent sensory gizmo, such as a camera or microphone). The attached object grants a +2, +1 per 4 gizmo levels circumstance bonus on Perception checks using the appropriate sense (i.e. visual for a seeing-based sensory assisting device, hearing, and so on). Whenever the user attempts a Perception check while using the attached object, the user may choose to make themselves flat-footed until the start of their next turn to improve the distance at which Perception check DCs increase by +1 every 20 feet, +10 feet per 2 gizmo levels (up from +1 per 10 feet). Example: A gizmo level 8 sense extender would allow the user to see 50 feet before suffering a +1 to the Perception check DC for distance. Transmission: Commset: Your communicators can be used as free action that can be taken even when it is not the users turn; using a communicator this way is through auditory communication; this allows the communicators to transmit audio rather than only text-based messages. Transmission: Wireless Sensory Streaming: Sensory gizmos may be crafted as transmitters and can transmit information they record directly to other gizmos within signal range. The gizmo receiving the transmitted information must have a means to display and/or store the information (such as the input and display accommodation or a storage routine). The user must still attempt their own Perception checks, as appropriate, but otherwise treats shared sensory information as though it were their own senses.

A blaster gizmo is a weapon whose effects are determined by selecting one blaster damage type and one blaster shape when crafting a blaster; a blasters statistics are not modified by the gizmos size (or size changes). Unless otherwise stated, using a blaster is a standard action. You learn all of the blaster damage types and blaster shapes on gaining this talent. Blaster Damage Types: Select one of the following blaster damage types: Blaster Shapes: A blaster shape notes its damage when used, its range, the affected target, targets or area, and additional details (such as battery use abilities belonging to that blast shape, and so on). The following blaster shapes may be selected: Special - Disruption Set: If you possess the Disruption Set talent, in addition to selecting a blaster damage type and blaster shape, you may also select one disruptor effect. Creatures which fail their saving throw against your blaster (or are damaged, if no saving throw is allowed) must also attempt a saving throw against the chosen disruptor effect (as though struck by the disruptor). You must deplete batteries for the blaster and disruptor effects separately. Augmentation: You learn how to craft the following secondary functions: Computation: Collateral Exemption Protocol (gizmo, routine): A gizmo with this routine installed may always choose to leave buildings, structures, and other objects undamaged or unaffected by their effects. In addition, when the gizmo would affect an area, the gizmo may exclude up to a number of creatures equal to 1 + the gizmos practitioner modifier. Modification: Blaster Add-On (gizmo): This modification is attached to a weapon. A blaster add-on is crafted the same as a blaster gizmo (selecting a blaster damage type and blaster shape). As a special attack action, the user may use the blaster as part of making an attack with the attached weapon. On a successful hit, the blasters effects are also applied to the target (as though the target was also struck by the blaster, damaging the target directly; blaster shapes with an area of effect are instead centered on the target, granting the target a saving throw as normal).

Computation & Transmission: Remote Install: You may transfer routines into an eligible gizmo within signal range (rather than a gizmo within your natural reach). Transmission: Easy Detection: Detectors you craft do not render the user flat-footed while they are activated and in use, and the user may spend a standard or move action to keep a detector activated (rather than requiring a full-round action). Transmission: Relativistic Detection: Whenever you craft a detector, you may adjust it to return signature strength relative to the user or an object in the users possession or natural reach (rather than the normal signature strength tables). Determine the relative variable against the signature strength of detected targets using Table: Relativistic Signals (see Mastering Gizmos, Detector Reference Tables). Example: If an ecology sensor is adjusted with this ability, it would return signature strength based on the users Hit Dice if looking for a creature relative to the user, or could be used to detect for dragons if the user had a dragon to set as the relative variable within their reach, and an armament sensor would return signature strength based an object in the users possession (the relative variable relevant to the type of sensor). For detectors that search for more nuanced data and information (such as the heat sensor, whose signature strength is based on intensity), determine the signature strength by how many steps difference there is between the relative variable and the detected sources (use the relevant table for that sensor to determine steps from relative variable; such as the users own body heat being compared to outside temperatures). Transmission: Signal Range, Improved: The signals created by your gizmos reach further and penetrate deeper. Your detectors transmit their detection signal over a medium range and your transmitters project their signal over a long range. In addition your signals can now penetrate through barriers 5 times deeper (barring other modifications to signal penetration strength, this is generally: 15 feet of wood or dirt, 5 feet of stone, 6 inches of common metal, or a half inch of lead). Note: Multiplicative increases to signal penetration strength are additive, such as gaining an additional 2 times would stack with this talent to be 4 times penetration. Transmission: Signal Repeater (gizmo, minor): A signal repeater is a transmitter that generates a signal that sends no transmission of its own. Other transmitters treat a signal repeaters signal as part of their own signal (connecting their signal to the signal repeaters signal); this extended signal range may include other signal repeaters. Effects that require line of effect still require line of effect from the base gizmo.

The user can use the attached equipment to pilot a single activated mechanoid within this gizmos signal range as if using an immersive cockpit and may split their actions between piloting the mechanoid or taking their own actions as they wish. A remote harness must be paired to a mechanoid before it can be used; pairing a remote harness can be done as part of maintaining the users gizmos. A remote harness can pair with any number of mechanoids but may only pilot a single mechanoid each round. Special - Mass Interface: A remote harness can be used to pilot multiple paired mechanoids within signal range using Mass Interfaces normal mass deployment ability. Alternatively, the user may use the remote harness to pilot each mechanoid as though using an immersive cockpit but must distribute actions between each (i.e. one taking a move action, another taking a standard action). Transportation: Compact Pilot Seat: You improve the passenger seats upgrade. A mechanoid with a compact pilot seat may be piloted by a creature the same size category as the mechanoid (rather than one size smaller than the mechanoid). Transportation: Covered Mechanoids: When you craft a mechanoid, you may grant the mechanoid the cover upgrade (this does not count against the mechanoids maximum upgrades; the mechanoid must still possess the passenger seat upgrade to qualify for the cover upgrade). Transportation: Discount Fabrication: When determining the project cost of your mechanoids, reduce the mechanoids effective gizmo level by 1 per 2 ranks in the associated skill (minimum 1 gizmo level when determining project costs). Transportation: Ejector Seats: You improve the passenger seats upgrade. Ejector seats have an ejector system built into each seat the passenger seats upgrade accommodates. When the mechanoid is destroyed (or its enclosure, if it possesses the enclosure upgrade), each passenger is ejected 30 feet from the mechanoid in a straight line. An individual passenger may willingly use the ejector seat belonging to their seat as an immediate action. The direction an ejector seat moves the passenger is chosen when the mechanoid is first crafted or after being adjusted by the pilot. A passenger seat is depleted after being used (each individual passenger seat may be depleted this way) and may be restored when the crafter maintains their gizmos. The pilot can spend a swift action to adjust any number of ejector seats, choosing any of the following: disable or enable any number of ejector seats for individual passengers, trigger any number of ejector seats for individual passengers, or change the direction the ejector seats will move the passenger for each individual passenger. If an ejector seat is used to avoid an attack or area effect that would harm the passenger, that passenger gains evasion and a +2 dodge bonus to their AC or Reflex save against the attack or effect; an unwilling passenger may attempt a Reflex save to avoid being ejected (remaining inside or atop the vehicle but without a seat). Special - Aviation Set: If you possess the Aviation Set talent, an ejector seat may be built with an innate glider gizmo. This innate glider gizmo is exclusive to the ejector seat and is destroyed when the ejected passenger reaches the ground, stops moving, or after 1 minute per gizmo level, whichever comes first. When the pilot spends a swift action to adjust the ejector seats, the pilot may disable or enable the innate glider gizmo for any number of ejector seats. Transportation: Quick Entry Seats: Whenever you craft a mechanoid with the passenger seats upgrade, you may choose to make the passenger seats be quick entry seats.

The weapon must be able to normally have the chosen weapon special feature (such as distracting, nonlethal, or performance on a ranged weapon, but not reach or trip). Modification: Weapon Hybrid (gizmo, minor): This modification is attached to one or more manufactured weapons (except siege weapons). The attached weapons may be wielded simultaneously, requiring the handedness of the largest component weapon (such as requiring 2 hands if it were a dagger and a greatsword). Shields may be attached in place of a weapon (the user loses the benefits of an attached shield any round they attack with one or more of the attached weapons unless the user possesses an ability to retain their shield bonus to AC when making a shield bash attack, such as the Shield sphere Bashing Shield talent or the Improved Shield Bash feat). Modification: Weapon Shifter (gizmo): This modification is attached to a manufactured weapon (except siege weapons); when this modification is crafted, the crafter selects 1 weapon, +1 weapon per 5 gizmo levels. As a swift action, the user may make the attached weapon shift into one of the chosen weapons (or back to the original weapon). The weapon retains all of its abilities, including being masterwork, enhancement bonuses, and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape (such as a keen longsword shifting into a greatclub would temporarily lose the keen special ability). If the original weapon is a double weapon and shifts into a weapon without the double special feature, you choose which end of the weapons enhancement bonuses are retained. If the original weapon shifts into a weapon with the double special feature, you choose which end of the double weapon inherits the weapons abilities.

Expanded Arsenal Gizmo (requires Arsenal Set): You may craft arsenal gizmo as higher-complexity equipment or consumables (such as alchemical or technological items, poisons, modern and advanced firearms, siege weapons, or other complex equipment or consumables subject to GM discretion). If the crafted equipment has a saving throw DC, the arsenal gizmo uses its gizmo DC in place of the normal DC. The crafter no longer needs to have seen or studied a piece of equipment to craft it. When crafting an arsenal gizmo, you may supply special materials, crafting the resulting arsenal gizmo from that material. The special materials costs must be fully supplied for an item of that kind (i.e. 1,000 gp of adamantine for a longsword). Special material costs may be paid for with project materials. Additionally, at GM discretion, unusually expensive equipment may require project materials equal to the equipments normal cost. Arsenal gizmos crafted with project materials are not treated as a project, and are crafted as a normal gizmo, but may be salvaged for project materials when abandoned. At GM discretion, powerful items available through this talent should also be treated as an advanced minor gizmo (such as certain alchemical or technological items, expensive siege weapons, etc.). Note - Expensive Equipment, Exotic Equipment, and More: This ability grants potentially wide, carte-blanche access to weaponry and equipment that may not otherwise be available. For equipment that would not exist in the GMs setting, the GM should restrict a character from crafting such equipment. When crafting expensive equipment, the GM may restrict the total cost of such equipment, such as with the suggested formula 50 x (associated ranks)^2; allowing 50 gp at 1st level and 20,000 gp at 20th level, or another formula as the GM sees fit. For especially higher-technology settings and games, GMs may permit crafting Starfinder weaponry using this talent (treating a Starfinder weapon as a full gizmo). A character should not be able to craft a Starfinder weapon whose weapon level is higher than the characters ranks in the associated skill. Starfinder weapons use their own rules; GMs should be prepared to adjudicate, adjust, or convert such weapons where conflicts may arise. Expanded Energy Damage (requires 10 ranks in Associated Skill): Your gizmos which select an energy type gain additional benefits as follows: Note - Other Tinker abilities which would deal energy damage may also gain expanded access to the above energy damage types, subject to GM discretion (which may require depleting additional batteries to use). Improved Range, Blasters (requires Technological Weapons): Your blaster shapes range increases by 1 step (close to medium, medium to long, etc.). Improved Range, Disruptors (requires Disruption Set): Your disruptor gizmos range increases to medium range.

Augmentation: Legendary Aerobic Enhancer (requires Exploration Set): A physical augmentation modified as an aerobic enhancer allows the user to measure how long they can run or hold their breath in hours (instead of rounds). The aerobic enhancers battery use ability removes the fatigued and exhausted conditions and grants immunity to the fatigued and exhausted conditions for the gizmos duration. Augmentation: Legendary Load Bearer (requires Pressure Jack): A physical augmentation modified as a load bearer also makes the user count as 1 size category larger when determining their carrying capacity. An advanced load bearer also allows carried items to retain their cohesion, even if lifting force only applied to a small segment of the object would normally break it. Augmentation: Legendary Spring Boots (requires Pressure Jack): A physical augmentation modified as spring boots may accumulate pressure once per round as a free action. In addition, the user may attempt an Acrobatics check to jump as a swift action, even if there is no surface to jump off of, and may jump this way during other movement (such as during another jump to change directions, while falling, etc.). While the spring boots battery use ability is active, the user may attempt a jump this way once per round as a free action. Augmentation: Sustainer (gizmo): The user no longer needs to sleep or eat and gains the benefits of 8 hours of sleep through 2 hours of rest. This does not allow the user to rest and regain their resources more than once per day (similar to using a ring of sustenance). This augmentation must be worn and active for 24 hours before granting its effects; when a sustainer augmentation that was providing benefits to a creature becomes deactivated, that creature immediately becomes exhausted."

            "benefit": "Computation: Competency Routine (gizmo, routine): When crafting this routine, choose 1 skill, +1 skill per 4 gizmo levels and 1 ability score (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). This routine grants no benefits unless its battery use ability is activated: Computation: Fractional AI: Instead of determining the total number of AI you may have crafted at one time as a fixed number (by default, 1), you instead craft any number of AI provided that the total gizmo level of crafted AI does not exceed your ranks in the associated skill (similar to crafting mechanoids). For example, a Tinker sphere practitioner with 10 ranks in the associated skill could have a single gizmo level 10 AI, two gizmo level 5 AI, or any combination in between, so long as their total gizmo level does not exceed 10. If you exceed this limit, you must choose which AI to abandon. For the purposes of this ability, an AI classification which could be crafted in pairs (but treated as a single AI, such as Bestial or Drone) its treated as 1 effective gizmo level per 2 gizmo levels it possesses (rounded up). For example, a gizmo level 6 AI with the Drone classification would be counted as gizmo level 3 when determining the total gizmo levels of your crafted AI. Computation: Instant Language Recognition (requires Cognitive Set): Your translator routines instantly gain basic proficiency with any language they encounter, immediately upon encountering it. Translator routines gain proficiency with a language 10 times faster. Computation: Storage Network (gizmo, project, routine): You may craft a project-scale storage routine (called a storage network). A storage network requires 100 gp of project material per gizmo level. A storage network can retain 1,000 times the information of a storage routine of the same gizmo level. A storage network may be crafted with an in-built host gizmo that does not count against your gizmo limit (rather than installed into another gizmo). Multiple storage networks may be crafted, although each has its own storage. Special - Hammerspace: The storage network is treated as an extradimensional space and has unlimited storage. The project cost is unaffected (determining gizmo hit points and other statistics as normal). Special - (Transmission) Package: The storage network functions as a transmitter; gizmos within signal range may treat the storage network as an installed routine and access, use, upload, or remove information to the storage network. Multiple storage networks may link and share information with one another, allowing the stored information to be preserved and updated. Computation: Technopathic Controls (accommodation): Your gizmos may be activated or used by issuing mental commands; this allows a gizmo to be activated or used as a mental-only effect (rather than requiring the user to be capable of physical actions). A user that is panicked or incapable of concentrating (such as a raging barbarian) cannot use mental commands. Just like the Sensory Set voice controls accommodation, technopathic controls may be customized to only be usable by a chosen creature (or creatures, designated when crafting) to avoid unwanted creatures activating the gizmo. This accommodation also allows a user to remove the ability to activate or use a gizmo through physical means. Note - Other Controls: Subject to GM discretion, this accommodation can allow a user to define other forms of unique interfacing, such as requiring a specific race or genetic makeup, detecting a creatures allegiances, or other designation. A designation should be one that a detector could detect, and may require other talents (such as requiring Medical Set to have a gizmo read the users biological signal before allowing use). Computation & Transmission: Machine Speaker (gizmo): You craft a transmitter that allows the user to speak directly to other technology (gizmos, machinery, constructs, other mechanical objects, etc.). The user is treated as having a shared language and can speak to and understand the technology (even if the technology could not normally communicate). The technology may communicate what else has touched it, operated it, what is inside of it, details of who crafted it, etc. Any details are given as general properties (weight, size, color, number), but not more detailed information. If the technology can store information (such as a storage routine), it may communicate about its stored information. An unwilling piece of technology (or technology with security measures or other means of preventing access) is granted a Will saving throw against this gizmo's gizmo DC; treat the technology as having a gizmo level equal to its CR, caster level, or other appropriate statistic if it lacks a saving throw."

Power Magnate: You can maintain 1 additional power plant gizmo, +1 per 5 ranks in the associated skill you possess. Each power plants batteries are produced and maintained individually. Computation: AI Multithreading (requires 5 ranks in associated skill): Your AI may be used in place of a battery whenever activating the battery use ability of a routine installed in the same host gizmo. Using an AI as a battery this way renders the AI incapable of taking actions for the battery use abilitys duration (minimum 1 round, becoming active at the start of the users next turn). As a free action, the user may end the battery use ability early to allow the AI to act normally again. The AIs gizmo level must be equal to or greater than the routines gizmo level to be used as a battery this way (the same as using a normal battery). Computation: AI Multithreading, Hardware Passthrough (requires 15 ranks in associated skill): The multithreading ability may now be used to power non-routine gizmos. Transmission: Wireless Charger: Your power pack gizmos may be crafted as a transmitter. The power pack no longer needs to be attached to other gizmos and instead grants its benefits (allowing other gizmos to use its attached batteries) so long as those gizmos are within the power packs signal range.

Digging a tunnel or performing underground excavation takes longer and requires 1 hour (up from 1 minute) for each use. Tunnels created this way are generally stable (unless disturbed by another factor); personal excavators can reinforce tunnels created by other effects (such as a tunneling burrower) in 1 minute. In addition, your personal excavator gizmo gains the following battery use: Augmentation: Tunneling Burrower: Your burrower grants a burrow speed as though its battery use ability were always active. The burrower now allows the user to burrow through any surface, including crystal, glass, and metal, to a maximum hardness of 15, +1 per 2 gizmo levels (treating any surface with hardness 8 or greater as a harder surface for the reduced burrow speed). Your burrower gizmo can optionally leave behind tunnels. Tunnels created this way are equal to the users size and last for 1 minute per gizmo level before collapsing. Leaving behind tunnels may not always be possible (such as if digging through loose sand). The burrowers battery use ability now increases the users burrow speed to be equal to the users land speed (and 1/2 land speed for materials hardness 8 or greater). Modification: Killer Drill Destroyer: When your killer drill modification would cause a creature to attempt a Fortitude save or die, the death effect now bypasses a creatures immunity to death effects and affects creatures immune to Fortitude saves (such as constructs or undead). A creature that fails their saving throw and dies explodes into a burst of matter, dealing 1d8 slashing damage per 2 gizmo levels in a 10-foot radius from the dead creatures space (Reflex half). The killer drills user is unaffected by this explosion. In addition, your killer drill modification gains the following battery use:"

Augmentation: Additional Function: Your prosthetics can be crafted with 1 additional secondary function (in addition to other sources of additional secondary functions, such as from the Multifunctional Gizmos talent). Augmentation: Natural Prosthetics (requires Prosthetics Mastery): Prosthetics you craft are treated as natural prosthetics (see 4.1: Mastering Gizmos, Natural Prosthetics). A supplemental prosthetic is fully usable as a normal body part, limb, or organ of that kind (and no longer has the restrictions or downsides of a supplemental prosthetic, such as a supplemental arm being unable to wield weapons and make attacks). Subject to GM discretion, natural prosthetics may allow the user additional basic functionality the prosthetic could not normally do (such as a wing prosthetic now offering natural flight to its user). Note - Limiting Natural Prosthetics: This ability allows a character to potentially create highly-problematic combat characters, primarily through multiple weapons and multiweapon fighting interactions. A character can only use a limited number of natural prosthetics for combat actions (attacking, wielding weapons and shields, etc.) in addition to their normal limbs, equal to 2, +1 per 5 Hit Dice. This limitation includes natural attacks granted by prosthetics (in excess of the creatures normal natural attacks). This limitation may be adjusted, increased, decreased, or removed by GM discretion, such as basing the limitation on gizmo level (requiring all prosthetics be the same minimum gizmo level), basing the limitation on the characters total attacks, or there being no limitation at all (such as in unusually high-optimization games). Augmentation: Rapid Retrieval: The user may retrieve stored items from their storage capacity as a free action once per round. Augmentation: Natural Weapons (requires Primal Augmentations): Any prosthetic you craft may be crafted with a natural attack (corresponding to its prosthetic type, see Table: Prosthetic Natural Weapons); only a single natural attack may be granted to a prosthetic this way. In addition, you may grant any prosthetic that has or grants a natural attack the hidden natural attacks secondary function (this does not count against the prosthetics normal secondary functions limit). This includes prosthetics that would replace or supplement a creatures normal natural attacks, such as a bears claw or a dragons bite. Note - Prosthetic natural attacks may be subject to the same limitation as natural prosthetics; subject to GM discretion, a character should not gain more than 2, +1 per 5 Hit Dice natural attacks from prosthetics beyond those they already possessed. This limitation may be similarly adjusted at GM discretion; in the case of a paired prosthetic (such as a pair of arms) or a body part or limb that is comprised of many lesser parts (such as wings belonging to an angel that are more accurately a large cluster of wings), no more than 2 natural attacks should be granted by a single prosthetic (i.e. granting 2 claw attacks to a paired set of limbs or 2 wing attacks from the cluster of angelic wings)."

This tracking device gizmo only grants its benefits to the attached weapon (providing the relative distance to, and ignoring the concealment of, the target) and lasts for 1 round, +1 round per 3 gizmo levels. Modification: Improved Misfire Manager (requires Ranged Set): Your misfire manager modification reduces the attached weapons misfire value by an additional 1. In addition, whenever the user loads the attached weapon, the user can choose to increase the attached firearms misfire value by 2 to add +2d6 damage to the users next attack action or attack of opportunity with the attached weapon (this benefit lasts until the attached weapon is fired). For every 5 gizmo levels, the user may increase the firearms misfire value by an additional +2 to add an additional +2d6 damage. Modification: Improved Range Amplifier (requires Ranged Set): Your range amplifier modification increases the attached weapons base range increment by +10 feet, +10 feet per 5 gizmo levels.

            "prerequisite": "  transmission .",
            "benefit": "Augmentation & Transmission: Wearable Sensors (gizmo): You may craft any detector you could make as a wearable sensor; a wearable sensor is an advanced gizmo. Computation & Transmission: Data Uplink (accommodation) (requires 5 ranks in associated skill): If this accommodation is granted to a gizmo that could gather information or display information, the gizmo may automatically broadcast this information to other gizmos within signal range. For example, a detector could constantly broadcast its current sensed targets (or lack thereof), a camera sensory gizmo could share video, a health monitor could broadcast the users current vitals, and so on. Note - Other Information: Not every gizmo thoroughly states whether it creates information to be broadcast (such as a mechanoids hit points, the number of batteries a power plant has available, etc.). GMs should allow gizmos to communicate and provide data that a character could otherwise investigate and know if they observed the gizmo directly. Computation & Transmission: Cloud Guidance (requires 10 ranks in associated skill): A gizmo with the communicator accommodation may share its installed routines with other gizmos within the communicators signal range (excluding installed AI). A routine shared this way is treated as though it were installed in the recipient gizmo for all purposes. Multiple creatures can use a routine shared with cloud guidance, and benefit from the routine independently. An effect that depletes a battery will deplete that battery from that users gizmo (not the gizmo sharing the routine with cloud guidance). Transmission: Conductive Signals: Whenever you craft a signal-generating gizmo, you can choose to craft it to generate conductive signals. Choose one material or condition, such as light level (e.g. dim light or darkness, bright light), liquids (e.g. water), hazardous conditions (e.g. fire), contact (e.g. stone, plants or trees, etc.), or others subject to GM discretion. The gizmos signal travels through the selected condition, ignoring all intervening materials or substances, but only through the selected condition. Example: If the conductive medium is bodies of water, a detector must be immersed in a body of water to generate a signal, and can only detect things within signal range that are also immersed in bodies of water (though it does not have to be the same body of water). Transmission: Effortless Detection: Detectors may be activated as a full-round action. Whenever you deplete a battery to activate a detector as a standard action, the detector remains active for 10 minutes per gizmo level. Transmission: Improved Communicators: Your communicator accommodation can send up to 100 words with each use, +100 words per gizmo level after gizmo level 1. Transmission: Improved Specific Detection: You may adjust a detectors parameters for specific detection as a free action (rather than a standard action). When adjusting a detectors parameters for specific detection, the detector may be adjusted to sense for a specific individual, creature, or other piece of information (such as a specific density, temperature, etc.), and only that specific thing. Transmission: Reliable Detectors: When a detector allows its user to roll a skill check after sensing a target (i.e. a Knowledge check to identify a creature located by an ecology sensor), the user may roll twice and take the better result. Transmission: Signal Range, Greater (requires 10 ranks in associated skill, Transmission Mastery): Your detector signal range improves to long and transmitter signal range improves to extra long. Transmission: Signal Range, Superior (requires 15 ranks in associated skill, Transmission Mastery): Your detector signal range improves to extra long and transmitter signal range improves to unlimited (provided the gizmo and what it detects or transmits to is on the same plane). This signal is still blocked by sufficient barriers. For the purposes of other effects that would reduce or modify your signal range, your transmitter signal is treated as extra long. Gizmos you craft that can be controlled or activated from a distance can now be controlled or activated from any distance, so long as they are on the same plane (and no longer require line of effect). The user does not have awareness of a gizmos location or status unless provided through another source (such as a camera). For example, if controlling a mechanoid from a distance without a means of visual feedback, the pilot would be operating the mechanoid blind.

A turrets project cost is based on its size, along with its damage and other statistics; the maximum turret size you can craft is determined by your ranks in the associated skill (see Table: Turrets). A turret is a gizmo which is operated by piloting the turret (similar to piloting a mechanoid) and possesses the following statistics: A turret must be mounted on a flat surface (including walls of ceilings) before being activated, and is calibrated to its location upon activation. If the turret is forcibly moved or would become prone, it must be re-calibrated as a swift action before it can be fired again. A turret mounted to a sufficiently large surface (such as the deck of a ship) does not count as moving because the greater surface is moving, but would consider a small wagon as moving. A calibrated turret is piloted as a standard action, and may make a single standard action attack each round (including attack actions). Turrets are treated as having unlimited ammunition, and automatically reload themselves. Any creature piloting a turret is proficient with the turret, and does not suffer penalties for piloting a turret larger or smaller than themselves. The turret may benefit from its pilots abilities, feats, and talents (not the pilots modifiers). Special - Mass Interface: Multiple turrets may be piloted as a full-round action, but only a single turret may benefit from the pilots abilities, feats, and talents.

Special: Turrets gain additional functionality if you possess the following talents: Automator (gizmo, minor, project): An automator is a gizmo that can perform simple, basic functions, primarily interacting, using, or manipulating other gizmos or objects. An automator requires 5 gp of project material per gizmo level. The exact shape of an automator is determined when crafting, possessing up to 2 simple limbs'' whose shape can perform a specific, chosen task (such as an arm or pulley specifically to open a door, a drill to secure screws, a digit to press a button, and so on; this may include activating or deactivating a gizmo). An automator possesses a Strength score of 8 + 1 per 2 gizmo levels. Attaching or removing an automator from the object its station requires 1 minute of work (next to the door it is meant to open, on the factory line its meant to work on, etc.). An automator is used as a swift action and performs its chosen action until completed. Automators cannot perform an action that requires an attack roll. Special: Automators gain additional functionality if you possess the following talents: Note: Automators with multiple packages incorporated are meant to be capable of a modern-day factory floor, performing a complex process as a series of simple, individual actions. Augmentation: Personal Turret (gizmo): A personal turret can be mounted onto a creatures body, and is always considered to be calibrated. The turret must be 1 size smaller (or smaller) than the user and moves with the user. Unlike a normal turret, a personal turret is not a project and instead counts against the crafters gizmo limit. Augmentation: Quick Switch (gizmo) (requires 5 ranks in associated skill): A quick switch can be used to use another gizmo as a swift action (such as using a blaster or disruptor gizmo as a swift action, rather than a standard action). This does not allow a user to perform an attack action or other standard action-restricted action (other than using the gizmo). Augmentation: You learn to craft prosthetics with the following secondary functions: Computation: Automated Response (accommodation) (requires 10 ranks in associated skill): A gizmo granted this accommodation gains innate automators that allow the gizmo to be used in response to pre-chosen criteria. It takes 1 minute to program a single automated response with a successful proficiency check. A gizmo may only have a single automated response at a time; the conditions of the automated response must be clear, but can also be general (such as a health monitor observing a condition, a camera seeing a certain color, a detector sensing something within its parameters). The gizmo must have some way to be informed of its surroundings to activate this way (such as having Sensory Set sensory gizmos, receiving a signal from another gizmo, etc.). When the gizmos automated response is triggered, the automated response uses the gizmo in the chosen, predetermined way. An automated response triggers solely on the pre-chosen criteria; if convoluted or complicated criteria are given, the automated response may fail to trigger. Any variables or additional details must also be pre-selected, such as depleting batteries for a battery use ability, and so on. A creature cannot have multiple gizmos of the same kind with the same automated response, and automated responses cannot trigger other automated responses if the gizmo is in the same creatures possession (in essence, no chaining automated responses to one another). Note - Limiting Contingency-Like Effects: An automated response functions similarly to the contingency spell, except requires more effort to trigger (requiring the appropriate gizmo or effect to notice and detect stimulus, rather than magically being able to trigger). For this reason, automated responses are not limited to one per creature, although GMs may limit automated responses as necessary to prevent abuse or unfun gameplay. Transmission: Automated Control (accommodation) (requires Mass Interface): A gizmo granted this accommodation gains innate automators that allow the gizmo to be oriented and aimed by the user when using the Mass Interface remote control ability (or other means of using a gizmo remotely); this allows a gizmo to be oriented, aimed, and used normally despite the gizmo normally lacking independent movement (such as a fire extinguisher being able to swivel and point the correct direction before use).

Transportation: Full Integration: Your immersive cockpit upgrade may be further improved to allow for full integration. A pilot may initiate full integration as a 1 minute process; once complete, the pilot is fully integrated with the mechanoid (the integrated pilot).

Extradimensional spaces and other effects created by this talent are supernatural effects. Unless otherwise stated, creatures and attended objects cannot be placed into an extradimensional storage created by this talent. Augmentation: You learn how to craft the following secondary function: Modification: Endspace Storage (gizmo): This modification is attached to a manufactured storage container (such as a backpack, bottle, pockets, etc.). The endspace storage is an extradimensional storage with a capacity of 5 pounds per gizmo level. Objects may be stored or retrieved from this extradimensional storage whenever the user would store or retrieve an object from the attached container. Transmission: Extradimensional Signals (requires 10 ranks in associated skill, Advanced Transmission): Your signals can cross planes and are broadcast normally into layered planes (such as the Ethereal Plane). Connected planes (such as the elemental plane of fire) require your signal to pass through an existing portal or gateway to that plane. For layered planes, this does not allow a signal to cross to and from a plane (i.e. from the Material to the Ethereal Plane, travel unimpeded across the Ethereal Plane, and back to the Material Plane); the signal is treated as being individually generated on both the Material and layered plane (and is impeded by materials, distance, etc. normally). Other planar interactions are subject to GM discretion (such as general planar cosmology, etc.). Transportation: Endless Storage: You improve the storage upgrade. The contents of an endless storage no longer counts against the mechanoids carrying capacity and is an extradimensional space. Creatures and attended objects can be placed in this extradimensional storage. Transportation: Scalability: You improve the alternate size upgrade. As a full-round action, the mechanoid can change its size to any size category it could have been constructed as (such as changing from size Huge to size Tiny, or any size in between). If the mechanoid could accommodate passengers, and the mechanoids current passengers could not fit due to this size change, the passengers are safely ejected into adjacent squares while shifting. A mechanoid with this ability has its project cost determined as the largest (or smallest) size possible. Transportation: You learn to craft mechanoids with the following upgrades:"

See Section 1.2 Skill Rules, Linguistics for more details. Computation: Memory Fabrication (requires 5 ranks in the associated skill, Cognitive Set): You may create virtual forgeries of memories (see Section 1.2 Skill Rules, Linguistics for more details). A falsified or forgery of a memory cannot grant a creature new abilities, nor is the user required to believe the memory if they have other conflicting memories (although they may be deceived or convinced about the falsified memorys validity or truthfulness, i.e. with a Will saving throw, subject to GM discretion). In addition, you may tamper with a constructs memories (as though creating a virtual forgery of a memory). The construct must be willing or helpless for the entire duration the forgery is being made. This behaves similarly to a modify memory spell. If you have a forged memory already crafted, you may attempt to implant it into the target construct as a standard action that requires a touch attack (or other means of transferring data, such as a signal cable from the Energy Set talent). A successful Will saving throw prevents a memory from being implanted this way. Special - (Transmission) Package: A transmitter may broadcast a forged memory with its signal range directly to a creature with the construct type (rather than requiring a touch attack)."

            "benefit": "The full rules and reference table for radiation is located in Table: Radiation Effects (see Mastering Gizmos, Detector Reference Tables): Radiocarbon Analyzer (requires Medical Set): Your chemalyzer gizmo can now carbon date a sample from any living or organic substance (usually a carbon-based sample). The user may spend a swift action to carbon date the sample (determining its age) with a margin of error of 1 per 100 years. Augmentation: Toxin Filter: A physical augmentation assigned to Constitution also grants its bonus to the users saving throws disease, poison, and radiation-based effects. If this augmentation is worn for at least 24 hours, when the user rests, the user recovers 1 additional point of ability damage caused by diseases or poisons, and now also heals 1 point of ability drain caused by diseases, poisons, or radiation-based effects when resting. Modification: Radiation Infuser (requires Arsenal Set): Your elemental infuser gizmo may select radiation as its damage type; for the purposes of this gizmo, radiation damage is half of a selected energy type (chosen as normal for an elemental infuser) and half untyped. In addition, the elemental infuser gains the following battery use ability: Transmission: Radiation Sensor (gizmo): This detector gizmo senses radiation levels within its signal range. Determine the radiation level using Table: Radiation Effects (see Mastering Gizmos, Detector Reference Tables). The user may pinpoint detected targets that are irradiated more than 1 radiation level step compared to the square they occupy. Transportation: Radiation Resistant Enclosure: You improve the enclosure upgrade. It now blocks the harmful effects of radiation. Creatures within the mechanoids enclosure treat radiation originating from outside the sealed enclosure as 1 step less severe, +1 step per 5 gizmo levels after 5th (reducing medium to none at 10, high to none at 15, and severe to none at 20). In addition, passengers gain a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against radiation effects, increasing by +1 per 4 gizmo levels."

            "prerequisite": "You develop improved techniques to repair, preserve, and restore both objects and living beings alike.  Associated skill 5 ranks, .",
            "benefit": "Cold Storage (requires Infiltration Set, Medical Set): Your body bags preserve a corpse indefinitely, as though its battery use ability were always active. Reanimation Kit (gizmo) (requires 10 ranks in the associated skill, Medical Set, Repair Kits): You may craft a reanimation kit, a special repair kit that can return a creature to life. A reanimation kit may only be applied to a dead creature that has been dead for less than 1 day per gizmo level. A creature must be willing to be reanimated; if the creature is unwilling, the reanimation kit fails. Being reanimated causes the target to gain two permanent negative levels; if the creature is 1st level, it instead takes 2 points of Constitution drain (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it cannot be raised). A creature reanimated by this effect has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice, and any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Poisons and diseases are removed in the process of reanimating the subject, but magical diseases, curses and other maladies are not. The target corpse must be in a substantially whole state, and missing body parts are still missing; otherwise, mortal wounds and lethal damage to the body are repaired. A creature turned into an undead creature cannot be reanimated by this kit. If the subject was killed by a death effect, the user must attempt a gizmo penetration check with a DC equal to the death effects MSD (or 10 + the sources CR as appropriate; subject to DM discretion). Restoration Kit (gizmo) (requires Repair Kits): You may craft a restoration kit, a special repair kit that restores a destroyed piece of technology (such as a gizmo, timeworn technology, construct, non-magical object, or target healed as though it were an object and would be destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points). The targets hit points are restored to 2 hit points per gizmo level (to a maximum of the target technologys maximum hit points). If the technology was destroyed, depleted, or otherwise inoperable, it is returned to a usable state. If the restored technology has expendable resources or limited contents, they are not restored (such as an automatons core, if removed, would remain gone)."

        "security set (gizmo)": {
            "prerequisite": "You learn to craft the following gizmos that make protecting against intruders easier.   Security Measures.",
            "benefit": "Expanded Countermeasures: The following additional countermeasures may be granted to a gizmo (when selecting countermeasures from the Security Measures talent): Security Door (gizmo, project): A security door is a mechanical door which is crafted for a specific entryway, and includes its own reinforced door frame, whose details are chosen by the crafter (a swinging door, sliding or folding door, opening mechanism, and so on). A security door requires 5 gp of project material per gizmo level, per 5 foot square the door occupies (i.e. requiring 20 gp of project material per gizmo level for a 10 foot by 10 foot door). A security door has the normal statistics of a gizmo with the following changes: Optionally, the crafter may include the following additional statistics: An activated, unlocked security door can be opened or closed as a free action, whereas a deactivated security door cannot be opened by any normal means. Locking or unlocking the security door is a swift action. Activating or deactivating a security door requires a successful proficiency check. Installing or removing a security door to its frame requires 1 minute of work, and can only be removed while activated and unlocked. A security door comes with a simple lock (DC 20) by default, but can have different locks integrated into the door as part of crafting the security door (such as a security lock gizmo). Security Lock (gizmo, project): A security lock is a mechanical lock, whose details are chosen by the crafter (either requiring a physical key or a physical code entered on an interface). The key or physical code can be changed with 1 hour of work. A security lock requires 5 gp of project material per gizmo level. Locking or unlocking the security lock is a swift action with the key or code. A security lock can only be unlocked while activated; activating or deactivating a security lock gizmo requires a successful proficiency check. A security lock has a Disable Device DC of 30 + its gizmo level and is treated as a tricky device (1d4 rounds), improving to a difficult device (2d4 rounds) at gizmo level 10. Attaching or removing a security lock to another object requires 1 minute of work, and can only be removed while activated and unlocked. A security lock can be crafted as part of a security door gizmo so that if the door is locked or unlocked, or activated or deactivated, the lock is as well. Computation & Transmission: Telemetrics (accommodation): The gizmo gains an innate touch sensor. Transmission: Fault Detector (gizmo, project): A fault detector is a project detector that is installed at various points of a building to detect for damage or structural issues. A fault detector requires 20 gp of project material per gizmo level. A fault detector is activated with 10 minutes of work, and once activated cannot be moved or immediately deactivates. The detector constantly detects any damage done to the walls, doors, fixtures, and other structural elements of a building within signal range. A fault detector may broadcast a signal when it detects that a section of the building has suffered enough damage to break or destroy it, or if a creature is burrowing or moving through the building. This signal may trigger the countermeasures of other gizmos as though a proficiency check to use the gizmo was failed. Transmission: Security Detectors (accommodation) (requires 5 ranks in Associated Skill): Detectors you craft can be activated the same as a fault detector project, allowing the detector to be constantly activated, but placed in a specific location and unable to be moved without deactivating. A detector may have its parameters changed, the same as a normal detector, and may broadcast a signal when it detects something within its parameters. This signal may trigger the countermeasures of other gizmos as though a proficiency check to use the gizmo was failed. A detector that does not sense a specific criteria of information (such as one that grants bonuses or a special sense to the user) cannot be granted this accommodation. A detector cannot attempt skill checks to identify what it senses; however, a user who receives the detectors signal (i.e. from an alert countermeasure, or having a gizmo which can display information and data) may attempt a skill check to identify the sensed target as though they were in possession of and using the detector. In addition to a security detectors normal parameters, the security detector accommodation may be given parameters to exclude permitted subjects from detection (such as specific creatures, certain uniforms, badges or equipment, etc.). You must be able to craft a detector that could already sense for such parameters Transmission: Touch Sensor (gizmo, minor): A touch sensor is a transmitter that is attached directly to an object (as though attaching a modification). The touch sensor constantly monitors if the attached object has been moved or interacted with (including extradimensional travel or teleportation), and broadcasts its signal whenever the gizmo is moved. This signal may trigger the countermeasures of other gizmos as though a proficiency check to use the gizmo was failed. Interacting with the attached object without triggering the touch sensors signal requires a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 20 + gizmo level. Transmission: Whitelist Detection (requires Advanced Transmission): Your detectors may be granted any number of specific detections you could normally grant, specifically to exclude such targets from being detected. For example, if you could craft an ecology sensor, you could exclude any creature types, including specific creatures, from a detectors parameters. This is primarily used to create whitelists for the security detector accommodation. Special - (Computation) Package: A whitelist can be created, and shared through signals, from a central storage routine or similar database of information; this allows whitelists to be actively managed and adjusted without needing to perform maintenance on individual detectors, and to actively update whitelists as needed."

Incorporeal creatures treat your gizmos as though they were solid, allowing them to manipulate or hold the object, but also prevent an incorporeal creature from freely passive through the object (such as a wall or cage impeding movement). This also allows any effects your gizmos create to affect an incorporeal creature normally. This accommodation may be enabled or disabled (as though activating a gizmo). Augmentation: Ecto-Plating (gizmo): This augmentation infuses the user's body to protect against the incorporeal. The users natural armor bonus counts against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. Augmentation: Incorporealizer (gizmo) (requires 10 ranks in Associated Skill): An incorporealizer grants no benefits unless its battery use ability is activated. Computation: Ghostly Circumventor (gizmo, routine): The routine grants a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects originating from incorporeal creatures, +1 per 7 gizmo levels. Modification: Ghostly Infuser (gizmo): This modification is attached to another object up to size Medium, +1 size category per 3 gizmo levels. The attached object is treated as though it were solid to an incorporeal creature (as though benefiting from the ghost touched accommodation). If attached to weapons, armor, or shields, the attached object gains the ghost touch special ability. If you would attach this modification in such a way that it would trap an incorporeal creature (such as attaching it to a cage), the incorporeal creature may attempt a Reflex save to immediately move to the nearest unoccupied space outside the attached object. Transmission: Specter Sensor (requires Transmission Mastery): Your ecology sensor detector may choose incorporeal creatures as though it were a creature type or subtype. For the purpose of this ability, creature-like effects such as an unseen servant spell and other similar projections of force are considered to be incorporeal. When detecting for incorporeal creatures, the detectors signal can penetrate any material (except those with the ghost touch special ability, modified by the ghost touched accommodation, etc.). Note: Subject to GM discretion, other creature properties similar to incorporeal may be sensed by this talent (i.e. gaseous body, ethereal creatures, etc.)."

A teleporter must target a creature or object within the natural reach of the user (or otherwise in physical contact with or adjacent to the teleporter). A teleporter can move a target to another location within signal range, provided that there is free space for the teleported creature or object to occupy. Teleporters cannot be used without their battery use ability. Special: Teleporters gain additional functionality if you possess the following talents: Advanced Transmission (requires 10 ranks in associated skill; signal range, greater; Transmission Mastery): Teleporters can be used for long-distance teleportation that is greater than their signal range will normally allow for. A teleporter modified with this ability is an advanced gizmo. When using a teleporters battery use ability, you may deplete 2 additional batteries to teleport up to 10 miles per gizmo level, or up to 100 miles per gizmo level to the location of another known advanced teleporter.
