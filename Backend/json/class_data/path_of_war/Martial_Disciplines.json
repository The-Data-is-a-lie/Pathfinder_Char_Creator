If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional 6d6 points of damage, and the target becomes cursed for 24 hours. While cursed by this strike, the target suffers a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill, checks. Whenever an affected target succeeds on an attack roll, saving throw, or skill, check, the penalty imposed by this strike increases by 2. Whenever an affected target fails on such a roll, it must succeed at a Will save DC 17 + your initiation modifier or become panicked for one round, and the penalty imposed by this maneuver is reset to 2. A creature under the effect of this strike can choose to intentionally fail on any of these rolls to make another saving throw against this effect. If it does, failure does not cause it to become panicked, nor does it reset the penalty to 2."

A sunlight shield can be created anywhere within close range 25 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels of you to include in the air, where they oat until destroyed, dismissed, or removed.

You may have a number of sunlight shields equal to your initiation modifier, and these shields last indefinitely, or until they are no longer within close range of you, you dismiss them as a free action, or you leave this stance. These sunlight shields can be made at any angle, and are treated as normal terrain when stepped on. You may command these shields to y an amount of feet equal to your movement speed as a move action. You may also create a sunlight shield as an immediate action, but doing so is dangerous as the hasty construction leaves your essence tied to it. Until the start of your next turn, any damage that the shield takes before hardness is taken into account, or any spell that would fail because of the shields sudden appearance between its caster and its target is also inicted on you, regardless of distance. Creatures can attack other creatures on the other side of these shields, dealing damage to the shield first. If an attack would break the shield, the remainder of the damage is dealt to the creature if the original attack would have hit. When you enter this stance, you may designate any number of allies. These allies attacks and abilities are not impeded by your sunlight shields.",

This replacement maneuver is readied when you gain it and granted, if you use granted maneuver recovery. The replacement maneuvers level cannot exceed half your highest maneuver level known. At the end of the encounter, you replace the chosen maneuver with aligned with prediction again on your readied maneuvers list. Alternately, you may activate this counter immediately before the start of one of your turns. This allows you to replace it with another maneuver known as above, but gives no bonuses to your initiative."

The triggering action completely resolves before the attack hits, so this maneuver cant damage a creature to interrupt spells with casting action of a standard action or less, or similar actions. You can only maintain one active instance of this maneuver at a time: if you initiate it again, it makes any existing effect end. If you lose knowledge of the maneuver, or replace it in your readied maneuvers list when choosing readied maneuvers again, any active instance of this maneuver ends. You use up one non-creature thrown weapon or piece of ammunition when initiating this strike, which cannot be retrieved until the strike triggers or otherwise ends. The weapon or ammunition used lands in a random space adjacent to the target, or in the space you were in when you initiated the strike if it ended without triggering, unless you have another ability that would return it to you. If excessively complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the strike immediately fails and has no effect. If the condition could be triggered by obscured information such as due to lies or stealth, it uses 10 + your knowledge geography skill modifier in place of any relevant skills such as sense motive or perception and is treated as observing the event from 5 feet away with all your senses to determine judgement on if it triggers. The maneuvers magic makes its own judgement and does not tell you any of this other observed information."

You do not need to see a target or have line of effect to it, and the attack ignores miss chances. Your ranged attack automatically blasts a hole the size of the projectile through any intervening object or barrier with hardness less than 50 without stopping. All creatures except you and the target within 10 ft. of the path of the attack must make a Reflex save DC 17 + your initiation modifier or be pushed 15 feet away from it, and fall prone if not airborne. If they are directly within the line of fire, they instead take 10d6 damage on a failed save, and half on a success. All unattended large or smaller objects in range are pushed automatically. If the attack hits the main target, they take damage as normal plus an additional 14d6 points of damage, and must make three Fortitude saves in a row DC 17 + your initiation modifier, affects objects, automatically passing the remaining saves once they succeed on any. If they fail one save, they are stunned for 1 round. If they fail two saves, they are stunned and paralyzed for 1 round. If they fail all three, they explode and die. The third fortitude save is a death effect."

You may use your initiator level in place of your base attack bonus for this full attack. Instead of choosing targets or using the normal rules for drawing trails, you instead create a 15-foot-radius burst at any point within range for each attack you could have made. For each burst, roll the attack once and compare it to the AC of all creatures within the area, dealing the attacks damage normally to each creature hit. All spaces included in the areas of your bursts become a trail. When an enemy enters this trail, a flare of energy erupts from it to strike them. They must make a Fortitude save DC 17 + your initiation modifier, affects objects or take 10d6 force damage and receive negative levels equal to half their total hit dice, halving the damage and avoiding the negative levels on success. Negative levels received this way last until the end of the creatures next turn, and do not reduce a creatures current or maximum hit points. Negative levels from multiple instances of this maneuver do not stack. All bursts are considered part of the same trail, so as usual each enemy can only be affected once by this extra damage even if they move through multiple burst areas.

When you initiate this boost, choose a creature that you can currently see or have seen within the last round, including indirect viewing such as via the Scrying spell. The next ranged attack you make this turn can target that creature no matter where they are: after being fired, the attack tears open a portal within 30 ft. of you that fills an unoccupied 5-foot space and is linked to an identical portal that appears in a random unoccupied space that is adjacent to the target and has line of effect to it, where the attack continues out of and targets the enemy. You may make the attack roll for this attack three times and take the highest result. The portals persist for 1 round, but you may dismiss them earlier as an immediate action. Creatures that can see through one portal can also see anything that they would be able to see if they were inside the space of the other portal: if you can see the target through the portals, your attack does not take any penalties for being unable to see the target when the attack was made. Any creature that enters the space of one portal is teleported to an eligible space of their choice adjacent to the other portal as a free action. Ranged attacks, spells, and other targeted effects can be aimed through a portal, entering it and continuing out of the linked portal in a direction of the users choice, totaling the distance travelled towards one portal and out the other for range and range increments. [Trail] strikes that enter a portal continue being drawn after emerging from the other portal as normal. However, melee attacks, threatened areas, auras, area effects, unattended objects, and environmental effects such as heat, air, water, and gravity do not cross over between portals. This maneuver has no effect if either portal would be created in an area where teleportation is barred, if there are no eligible spaces for a portal to appear, or if the target is under the nondetection spell or similar effect that hides their location from divination magic. Otherwise, this maneuvers range even extends to other planes, as long as either portal would not be created in an area where planar travel is barred. At 16th initiator level, effects that protect from divination do not stop this maneuver from working unless they also guard against the discern location spell."

      "Description": "Imbued in your strike is the immutable fate of the universe, the ordinant song by which the greatest stars in the cosmos live and one day die. Make a 120-foot trail ranged attack: if it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal. Immediately after the trail is drawn, it shines fiercely and erupts in a fleeting but brilliant supernova: creatures and objects in the trails area take 6d6 force damage and become flatfooted for 1 round. A creature that was directly hit by the trail strike is also blinded for 1 round and automatically fails their next reflex save against this trail. At the end of your turn, the radiance of the trail fades and darkens, pulling light and space into it as it collapses into the form of a black hole. Whenever an enemy starts their turn within 20 ft. of an unoccupied space in the trail, they must make a Reflex save DC 18 + your initiation modifier or be pulled 20 feet in a straight line towards the closest such space - colliding with a stationary obstacle will stop this movement. An enemy that starts their turn in the trail must also make this reflex save: on failure they are treated as having entered the trail even though they didnt move. Enemies and objects that enter the trail are crushed by the immense gravity, taking 6d6 magical bludgeoning damage, and are pinned until the start of your next turn. This trail uses your own combat maneuver bonus and combat maneuver defense for interactions with the pinned condition. A successful Fortitude save DC 18 + your initiation modifier, affects objects halves the damage and negates the pinned condition. When within 20 feet of the trail, any creatures movement in a direction entirely away from it costs double, and enemies cannot take the 5-foot step action."

Soaring makes you fly up to 30 feet in a straight line in any direction without provoking attacks of opportunity and is a free action. You can also soar without using an action immediately before the start of any creatures turn in initiative. Soaring extends one of your active trails, filling each space you move through with the effect of the trail which also spreads upwards and downwards as normal - these extensions from soaring only last 1 round, or when the trail they are extending ends, whichever comes first. Whenever one of your trails would end, a chain of explosions ripples along it, and all creatures and unattended objects of your choice in the trail take force damage equal to your initiator level before the trail dissipates.

Your attack creates a legion of phantasmal soldiers in its wake, translucent forms in the shapes of bodies that are illuminated by fierce star-like points of light within them, connecting with each other with lambent paths to form unknown constellations. Make a 400-foot trail ranged attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal. The trail from this maneuver then becomes filled with intangible images of the Stellaris Army. Whenever an enemy enters the trail, starts their turn within 60 feet of any space in the trail, or moves into that range for the first time on their turn, the Stellaris Army opens fire on them with slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, unless you command them not to. This deals 3d6 damage of a type of your choice that cannot be reduced, negated or avoided in any way. Damage dealt by the Stellaris Army cannot be healed unless by effects with an initiator or caster level higher than your own initiator level, or unless you allow it to be healed. When you are within 60 feet of the trail, once per round as a free action on your turn you can designate a 15-footradius burst originating from any other point within 60 feet of it. The Stellaris Army concentrates fire on that area, immediately dealing another 3d6 damage to all enemies and objects in the area, and treating all creatures in the area as if they entered a trail from any Sagitta Stellaris [trail] strike of your choice up to 5th level, even strikes you do not know. This is an instantaneous effect that does not create an additional trail, and if it requires a save DC, the DC becomes 19 + your initiation modifier. You can give the Stellaris Army instructions to attack or ignore certain types of creatures, based on visual information. Treat the Army as if they had truesight for their judgement, but they cannot communicate any information to others. The Army can see and fire into any overlapping planes to hit creatures in range, and by default they do not fire on unconscious creatures unless instructed otherwise. Unlike other [trail] maneuvers, this trail does not expire until you create it again, die, dismiss it as a free action, lose knowledge of the maneuver, or replace it in your readied maneuvers list when readying maneuvers again. Its effect triggers once per round per valid creature as long as it persists, rather than only once per creature. It does not end when you create a different trail with another maneuver. If another ability refers to your active trail when you have two trails this way, you choose one of the two trails for the abilitys purpose when you use it, or once per round on your turn. Extensions of this trails area created by other abilities are not permanent, and last until the start of your next turn. You can never have more than one trail with this maneuvers effect at once - if you would have multiple trails with this effect for any reason, all immediately end except for the newest instance."

As a full round action, the initiator may become incorporeal for one round and restore twice his ranks in Stealth in hit points to himself. Every time the initiator makes the transition between planes, however, he runs the risk of potentially losing himself there briefly. The initiator initiating this maneuver must make a Will save DC 14, +1 DC for every time hes initiated this maneuver since he last rested for 8 hours after the first use; if successful, the maneuver works as normal. If the saving throw fails, the initiator does not regain any hit points, instead suffering 2d6 points of damage, and spends the next 2d4 rounds lost in the borderland between the Prime Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, and when he returns to the Prime, he is fatigued for an hour.
