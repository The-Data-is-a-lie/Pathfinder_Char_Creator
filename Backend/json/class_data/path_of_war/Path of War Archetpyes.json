The omen rider can magically call their mount to their side as a full-round action a number of times per day equal to 3 + the omen riders initiation modifier. When she does, the mount immediately appears adjacent to the omen rider. The mount can be dismissed as a move action.

Only one of the ravenlord or his dark messenger can initiate a strike in a single round (that is, if the dark messenger initiates a strike, the ravenlord may not initiate a strike until the next round, and vice versa).

The dark messengers ability scores do not change when it uses this ability. This ability replaces massacre.",
      "Unwanted Missive (Su)": "At 11 level, a ravenlord gains the ability to swap places with his dark messenger once per encounter as an immediate action. In order to use this ability, the ravenlord and his dark messenger must be within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per ravenlord level) of each other. If the ravenlord uses this ability in response to one or more attacks or effects targeting himself or the dark messenger, each becomes the potential target of such effects targeting the other. For example, if the ravenlord is targeted with a charge attack, he can activate this ability to exchange places with his dark messenger. The dark messenger would then be the target of the charge attack. This is a teleportation effect, and if either the ravenlord or his dark messenger are prevented from teleporting for any reason (such as by adimensional anchorspell), the ability fails and its use for the encounter is expended. At 17th level, the ravenlord can use this ability twice per encounter. This ability replaces black omen and rumors of war.",
      "Memories of Loss (Su)": "Starting at 13th level, the Gloom generated by a ravenlords channel of woe class feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to his ravenlord initiation modifier modifier. Additionally, opponents within the Gloom become incapable of benefiting from insight or morale bonuses while within its area. This ability replaces dark murmur.",

The rosethorn princess can choose to not apply the damage bonus from accursed will to an attack if she wishes.",

      "Dark Claim (Su)": "The range at which a rosethorn princess may Claim a creature is always 60 feet + 5 feet per harbinger level if it would otherwise be shorter, including with feats such as Grasp of Darkness. The rosethorn princess loses the ability to make attacks of opportunity against a Claimed creature using the withdraw action to leave a square she threatens.",
      "Woodland Stride (Ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, a rosethorn princess may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.",
      "Kiss from a Rose (Su)": "A rosethorn princess imbues her desire for stagnancy into her ammunition as phantasmal seeds, which sprout from the wounds of her enemies into lush flowers and vines. Starting at 3rd level, she gains the ability to inflict a unique condition, bloom, onto her enemies. Bloom is a stacking condition that starts at bloom 1 and gets more severe with repeated applications: for example, a creature suffering from bloom 3 being inflicted with bloom 2 would then have the bloom 5 condition. However, bloom conditions inflicted by multiple rosethorn princesses on the same creature are tracked separately and do not stack with each other: apply only the effects of the highest severity.",
      "In Memoriam (Su)": "Once the blooming flowers can fully capture a creatures beauty, the original is no longer needed, and should fade before they sully their legacy. At 4th level, when a creature suffering any bloom from the rosethorn princess dies, or otherwise falls unconscious from hit point loss or nonlethal damage, the cursed plants around them surge and grow into a giant blossom that fills the creatures space, even if the creature did not leave a corpse. If the creature is alive or still has a body, the blossom is linked to them. Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than half the rosethorn princess character level do not create blossoms.",
      "The Language of Flowers (Su)": "At 7th level, the rosethorn princess is under a constantspeak with plantsspell effect.",
      "Drifting Memories (Su)": "Treasured recollections often shift over time, no longer reflecting what once was. At 8th level, once on each of her turns as a free action, the rosethorn princess can make one of her blossoms in range of her Claim ability move up to 15 feet. If the blossom is linked to a creature or corpse, the creature or corpse moves with it. No movement from this ability provokes attacks of opportunity. A blossom does not inflict bloom on adjacent enemies while moving, but it applies bloom as normal to adjacent enemies after it stops.",
      "Mourning Glory (Su)": "At 10th level, enemies within 5-foot of a blossom are automatically sickened for as long as they remain in range of it.",
      "Reminiscence (Su)": "At 11th level, the rosethorn princess gains the ability to teleport to any free space adjacent to one of her blossoms in medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) as an immediate action once per encounter.",
      "Harvest (Su)": "At 16th level, the rosethorn princess can make attacks of opportunity through her blossoms, spending her own attacks of opportunity to let blossoms attack when a creature would provoke one from them. Her blossoms each threaten an area out to 10 ft. around them, use the attack bonus of the rosethorn princess (including her strength or dexterity modifier, accursed will, and the enhancement bonus of any one weapon she is wielding) and her combat maneuver defense, and on hit deal 4d8 magical piercing damage and inflict the entangled condition for 1 round. The rosethorn princess can make an additional number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to half her intelligence modifier.",
      "Cherished Moment (Su)": "Starting 18th level, once per encounter as a move action, the rosethorn princess can draw on an idealized memory of a fallen enemy. She erases a blossom in range of her Claim ability, and in its space conjures a phantasmal copy of the creature that was linked to that blossom at full hit points, and with copies of all its equipment except artifacts. The copy is loyal to the rosethorn princess but has no true will of its own. The copy can immediately take a full turn of actions following directions from the rosethorn princess, and then disappears along with all its possessions when its turn ends. However, this copy can only use abilities or personal possessions that the rosethorn princess observed the original creature performing, and the original creature is immune to being directly affected by anything its copy does."

A blossom does not inflict bloom on adjacent enemies while moving, but it applies bloom as normal to adjacent enemies after it stops.",

She erases a blossom in range of her Claim ability, and in its space conjures a phantasmal copy of the creature that was linked to that blossom at full hit points, and with copies of all its equipment except artifacts. The copy is loyal to the rosethorn princess but has no true will of its own. The copy can immediately take a full turn of actions following directions from the rosethorn princess, and then disappears along with all its possessions when its turn ends. However, this copy can only use abilities or personal possessions that the rosethorn princess observed the original creature performing, and the original creature is immune to being directly affected by anything its copy does."

      "Spectral Steed (Su)": "At 1st level, an omen rider gains the ability to call forth a mount composed of spectral bone, ghostly plasm, and ghoulish sinew. This beast is roughly shaped as a heavy horse, sized appropriately for the harbinger. The omen rider can magically call their mount to their side as a full-round action a number of times per day equal to 3 + the omen riders initiation modifier. When she does, the mount immediately appears adjacent to the omen rider. The mount can be dismissed as a move action. A spectral steed has insubstantial hooves that make no sound and what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight and cannot attack, but other animals shun it and refuse to attack it.",
      "Ethereal Rider (Su)": "Starting at 5th level, when moving through battle or charging down a road, the omen rider and their spectral steed inspire ghostly legends of riders made of smoke and darkness. When the omen rider is mounted on their spectral steed, the omen rider and her mount gain a +2 dodge bonus to their AC and on Reflex saves. In any round where the spectral steed moves at least 20 feet, both the omen rider and her mount gain a 20% miss chance against attacks. Ghost touch weapons and effects that can affect incorporeal creatures normally ignore this miss chance.",
      "Reapers Claim (Su)": "At 8th level, the omen rider is able to drink deep of the ambrosia of a fallen foe and strengthen themselves or their steed. Whenever the omen rider reduces a creature she has Claimed to 0 or fewer hit points, she and her spectral steed gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice that creatures Hit Dice instead of recovering maneuvers. These temporary hit points last until the end of the encounter. This ability replaces ill intentions.",
      "Rumors of War (Ex)": "This ability functions normally, even when mounted.",
      "Dark Messenger (Ex)": "A ravenlord is served by a raven-like bird, known as his dark messenger. The dark messenger functions as a bird animal companion (using the ravenlords level as his effective druid level) with the following exceptions:",
      "Dark Focus (Ex)": "Both the ravenlord and his dark messenger gain the benefits of the ravenlords dark focus class feature, with the exception of the bonus feat gained at 6th level. This ability otherwise functions as normal. This ability alters dark focus.",
      "Channel of Woe (Su)": "At 3rd level, a ravenlords dark messenger gains the ability to initiate counters and strikes that the ravenlord has readied (expending them from the ravenlords readied maneuvers as normal). The dark messengers initiation modifier is Intelligence, and its initiator level is equal to the ravenlords initiator level. Only one of the ravenlord or his dark messenger can initiate a strike in a single round (that is, if the dark messenger initiates a strike, the ravenlord may not initiate a strike until the next round, and vice versa). When either the ravenlord or his dark messenger initiates a strike, the other generates a 10-foot-radius sphere of Gloom for one round. The Gloom is stationary and grants concealment to the creature that generated it for as long as that creature is within its area.",
      "Sorrows Shadow (Su)": "At 4th level, a ravenlords dark messengers type changes to magical beast and it gains Toughness as a bonus feat. Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, hit points (except those granted by Toughness), saving throws, or skills. In addition, the dark messenger can change its size once per round as a free action. At 4th level, it can become Small or Medium size, at 10th level, up to Large size, and at 16th level, up to Huge size. The dark messenger cannot use this ability to become smaller than Small size. The dark messengers ability scores do not change when it uses this ability. This ability replaces massacre.",
      "Unwanted Missive (Su)": "At 11 level, a ravenlord gains the ability to swap places with his dark messenger once per encounter as an immediate action. In order to use this ability, the ravenlord and his dark messenger must be within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per ravenlord level) of each other. If the ravenlord uses this ability in response to one or more attacks or effects targeting himself or the dark messenger, each becomes the potential target of such effects targeting the other. For example, if the ravenlord is targeted with a charge attack, he can activate this ability to exchange places with his dark messenger. The dark messenger would then be the target of the charge attack. This is a teleportation effect, and if either the ravenlord or his dark messenger are prevented from teleporting for any reason (such as by adimensional anchorspell), the ability fails and its use for the encounter is expended. At 17th level, the ravenlord can use this ability twice per encounter. This ability replaces black omen and rumors of war.",
      "Memories of Loss (Su)": "Starting at 13th level, the Gloom generated by a ravenlords channel of woe class feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to his ravenlord initiation modifier modifier. Additionally, opponents within the Gloom become incapable of benefiting from insight or morale bonuses while within its area. This ability replaces dark murmur.",
      "Whispers of Atrocity (Su)": "Both the ravenlord and his dark messenger gain the benefits of the ravenlords whispers of atrocity class feature. This ability otherwise functions as normal. This ability alters whispers of atrocity.",
      "Class Skills": "The rosethorn princess adds Appraise and Knowledge (Nature) to her list of class skills, and removes Knowledge (Religion).",

The rosethorn princess can choose to not apply the damage bonus from accursed will to an attack if she wishes.",
      "In the Eye of the Beholder": "At 1st level, the rosethorn princess gains Precise Shot as a bonus feat. She is also considered to have the Point- Blank Shot feat for the purposes of prerequisites but does not gain its benefits unless she actually possesses the feat.",
      "Dark Claim (Su)": "The range at which a rosethorn princess may Claim a creature is always 60 feet + 5 feet per harbinger level if it would otherwise be shorter, including with feats such as Grasp of Darkness. The rosethorn princess loses the ability to make attacks of opportunity against a Claimed creature using the withdraw action to leave a square she threatens.",
      "Woodland Stride (Ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, a rosethorn princess may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.",
      "Kiss from a Rose (Su)": "A rosethorn princess imbues her desire for stagnancy into her ammunition as phantasmal seeds, which sprout from the wounds of her enemies into lush flowers and vines. Starting at 3rd level, she gains the ability to inflict a unique condition, bloom, onto her enemies. Bloom is a stacking condition that starts at bloom 1 and gets more severe with repeated applications: for example, a creature suffering from bloom 3 being inflicted with bloom 2 would then have the bloom 5 condition. However, bloom conditions inflicted by multiple rosethorn princesses on the same creature are tracked separately and do not stack with each other: apply only the effects of the highest severity.",
      "In Memoriam (Su)": "Once the blooming flowers can fully capture a creatures beauty, the original is no longer needed, and should fade before they sully their legacy. At 4th level, when a creature suffering any bloom from the rosethorn princess dies, or otherwise falls unconscious from hit point loss or nonlethal damage, the cursed plants around them surge and grow into a giant blossom that fills the creatures space, even if the creature did not leave a corpse. If the creature is alive or still has a body, the blossom is linked to them. Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than half the rosethorn princess character level do not create blossoms.",
      "The Language of Flowers (Su)": "At 7th level, the rosethorn princess is under a constantspeak with plantsspell effect.",
      "Drifting Memories (Su)": "Treasured recollections often shift over time, no longer reflecting what once was. At 8th level, once on each of her turns as a free action, the rosethorn princess can make one of her blossoms in range of her Claim ability move up to 15 feet. If the blossom is linked to a creature or corpse, the creature or corpse moves with it. No movement from this ability provokes attacks of opportunity. A blossom does not inflict bloom on adjacent enemies while moving, but it applies bloom as normal to adjacent enemies after it stops.",
      "Mourning Glory (Su)": "At 10th level, enemies within 5-foot of a blossom are automatically sickened for as long as they remain in range of it.",
      "Reminiscence (Su)": "At 11th level, the rosethorn princess gains the ability to teleport to any free space adjacent to one of her blossoms in medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) as an immediate action once per encounter.",
      "Harvest (Su)": "At 16th level, the rosethorn princess can make attacks of opportunity through her blossoms, spending her own attacks of opportunity to let blossoms attack when a creature would provoke one from them. Her blossoms each threaten an area out to 10 ft. around them, use the attack bonus of the rosethorn princess (including her strength or dexterity modifier, accursed will, and the enhancement bonus of any one weapon she is wielding) and her combat maneuver defense, and on hit deal 4d8 magical piercing damage and inflict the entangled condition for 1 round. The rosethorn princess can make an additional number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to half her intelligence modifier.",
      "Cherished Moment (Su)": "Starting 18th level, once per encounter as a move action, the rosethorn princess can draw on an idealized memory of a fallen enemy. She erases a blossom in range of her Claim ability, and in its space conjures a phantasmal copy of the creature that was linked to that blossom at full hit points, and with copies of all its equipment except artifacts. The copy is loyal to the rosethorn princess but has no true will of its own. The copy can immediately take a full turn of actions following directions from the rosethorn princess, and then disappears along with all its possessions when its turn ends. However, this copy can only use abilities or personal possessions that the rosethorn princess observed the original creature performing, and the original creature is immune to being directly affected by anything its copy does."

These bullets or pellets are treated as mundane steel with no special abilities or properties, and after one of these bullets or pellets are used for an attack, it vanishes. However, due to the ephemeral nature of these pieces of ammunition, the gunsmoke mystic reduces the misfire value of the firearm by 1 (to a minimum of 1) while making attacks with her semi-real bullets. Firearms with multiple barrels or chambers (such as with apepperboxor arevolver) must spend one animus per barrel or chamber being loaded (the gunsmoke mystic does not have to load a firearm to full capacity if she chooses).

When a knight-chandler enters combat, she adds one point of illumination to her illumination pool at the start of her first turn, and one more point of illumination to her illumination pool at the start of each turn thereafter. In addition, a knight-chandler gains one point of illumination whenever she initiates a boost, and she can focus her power as aswift actionto add two points of illumination to her pool. A knight-chandlers illumination pool persists for one minute after the last enemy combatant is defeated or the encounter otherwise ends, after which it drops back down to one point.",

Until the beginning of the knight-chandlers next turn, that ally can initiate that maneuver as if they had readied it normally, using the knight-chandlers initiator level or their own, whichever is higher. If the ally chooses to initiate the maneuver, the knight-chandler expends that boost or counter (even if it isnt currently granted to her; if it wasnt granted to her, treat it as though it had been granted, then expended).",

Her type changes toOutsider, and she gains theNativeandGoodsubtypes. In addition, she ceases aging, and her minimum illumination becomes equal to her knight-chandler initiation modifier; increasing as normal during combat and resetting to her new minimum after spending one minute outside combat. Finally, the knight-chandler gains the ability to initiate two boosts with the sameswift action, expending each as normal.",

Such characters may not advance further as knight-chandlers until such a time as they cease being of evil alignment, though they do not lose access to their class features.

By doing this a senator recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to their rajah initiation modifier (minimum 1). Alternately, the rajah may concentrate on the akasha that flows through their body and recover a single maneuver as a standard action.",

This damage increases by one die step at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. You may use your initiation modifier in place of your dexterity modifier when making this ranged touch attack. This range touch attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and its damage comes from an akashic pulse of power, and as such is not reduced by damage reduction, hardness, resistances, or immunities.",

If they have the ability to attack creatures through an entitled ally, they can also attack the creature branded by the [brand] veil itself.

When the daayan shapes their veils for the day, they can bind one of their [brand] veils shaped using their daayan veil slots. If a brand has multiple chakras it can be shaped to, the daayan chooses which chakra slot they treat it as bound to when they shape the brand.

The kshatriya uses special rules when attacking and utilizing their combat talents through their allies, listed below.",

This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. If they already have either of these talents, they may select a Veilweaving talent of their choice to replace either duplicate. The sphere rajah does not learn a veil of their choice when gaining the Veilweaving sphere in this way. If they had already learned a veil from taking the Veilweaving sphere before taking this class, they lose knowledge of that veil if that veil is not part of their Tradition.",

A Claimed targets position is known to the soul hunter, even if they have total concealment against him (though he still suffers the normal miss chance if his target is concealed, and is denied his Dexterity bonus if the Claimed target attacks him).

When making an attack or initiating a martial maneuver against his Claimed target, the soul hunter may force this subtle disharmony to become a geyser of agony, as the soul hunters ki causes the targets life energies to ignite. This inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage at 1st level upon a successful attack, and this damage increases by an additional 1d6 points of damage every four soul hunter levels.
