For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon's energy type as fire. Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power. : When selecting spells known, you can choose spells from the psychic class spell list (",

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes. : Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell's save DC by 1.  The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as or ) or spells that allow a save (such as or ). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.  Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell's level."

The weapon’s Armor Class, hit points, and hardness are as normal for its size. It does not gain attacks of opportunity, nor does it provoke them, unless an opponent tries to grapple it.

        "benefit":"When a creature unsuccessfully attacks the slayer with a poisoned weapon or a natural weapon that would poison him, the slayer can attempt to redirect the attack to a creature within his reach (including, possibly, the creature that unsuccessfully attacked the slayer). As an immediate action, the slayer can make an attack roll against the creature to which he would redirect the poison. On a success, the poison is redirected to the target, and the target must attempt a saving throw against the poison as normal. This attack only redirects the poison and does not otherwise damage the targeted creature.

     "rogue talent":{
        "benefit":"A slayer can select one of the following rogue talents in place of a slayer talent. Any talent effects based on rogue level use the slayer’s class level.

     },
     "sever alignment* (su)":{
        "prerequisites":"aligned sneak attack",
        "benefit":"When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype, a rogue (or slayer) with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to scramble the creature’s metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the rogue’s level + the rogue’s (or slayer’s) Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities with alignment descriptors for 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage the rogue (or slayer) would have dealt (minimum 1 round)."
     },
     "slowing strike*":{
        "benefit":"An opponent damaged by the slayer‘s sneak attack has its speed halved for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer’s level + the slayer’s Intelligence modifier). Against creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer must choose which movement type to affect. If the slayer affects a creature’s flight movement, its maneuverability is reduced by one step; if it’s airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Fly check. If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability, its speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer may either extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected movement separately)."
     },
     "studied ally":{
        "benefit":"The slayer can study an ally or friendly creature he can see as a move action. The slayer gains a +1 bonus on checks and attack rolls to use the aid another action to help with that ally’s skill checks, attacks, or AC. This bonus increases at the same rate as a slayer’s studied target bonus. At th level, a slayer can study an ally as a move or swift action. A slayer’s studied ally counts against the number of studied targets he can have active at once."

     },
     "assassinate":{
        "benefit":"A slayer with this advanced talent can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must first study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the slayer as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the slayer’s level + the slayer’s Intelligence modifier. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and is then immune to that slayer’s assassinate ability for 24 hours."
     },
     "marksman’s shot":{
        "benefit":"As an attack action, the slayer makes a single ranged attack at his highest attack bonus with a ranged weapon he wields. The target of the attack must be the slayer’s studied target. On a successful hit, the slayer doubles the number of sneak attack dice applied to the attack; if the attack was not a sneak attack, this benefit does not apply."

     },
     "swallow reversal":{
        "benefit":"As an attack action, the slayer can make a single melee attack against his studied target at his highest base attack bonus. When attempting a swallow reversal, the slayer rolls two attack rolls and uses the highest result. If the attack is a critical threat, the slayer attempts to confirm the critical hit as normal. The slayer can use swallow reversal at will, but it can only be used against a given target once per day."
     },
     "woodland stride":{
        "benefit":"A slayer with this talent may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Terrain that is enchanted"

For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon's energy type as fire. Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power. : When selecting spells known, you can choose spells from the psychic class spell list (",

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes. : Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell's save DC by 1.  The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as chill touch or scorching ray) or spells that allow a save (such as fireball or lightning bolt). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.  Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell's level."
