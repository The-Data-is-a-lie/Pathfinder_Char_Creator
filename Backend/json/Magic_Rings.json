After Aroden's death, the rings were cast aside or lost. Recently, several resurfaced, but changed by unknown means— Gaspodar's face now bears a sorrowful expression, and flames loom behind him. As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring's power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring. As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points. The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring's charge is spent or the ring is destroyed. For this reason, owners of a ring of terrible cost guard the item carefully. Construction",

At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. Dancing lights  (once per hour) Light  (twice per night) Ball lightning  (special, once per night) Shooting stars  (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights , and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. Number of Balls Damage per Ball   1 lightning ball 4d6 points of electricity damage   2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage   3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage   4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round. The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball ) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. Faerie fire  (once per day) Spark shower  (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage. Construction",

Once per day, the wearer of this ring can perform a complex mental and verbal ritual, repeatedly whispering the ring's command word, while touching any humanoid corpse that has been dead for less than 1 week. The creature must have had 7 Hit Dice or fewer in life. This ritual can be as short as 1 round or could last up to 24 hours. It requires both total focus and constant contact between the ring, the wearer, and the target corpse. Interruption of any kind spoils the ritual, requiring the wearer to begin anew. The wearer of the ring chooses how long this ritual will last, but that decision must be made before she begins the ritual. On the ritual's completion, an illusory duplicate of the creature touched—partially real and formed of animate ice cloaked in magical shadow—springs into existence. This functions as lesser simulacrum in all ways unless stated otherwise. The wearer of this ring gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when performing this ritual. The shadow creature appears in all ways to be hearty and full of life, equipped with all of the gear and clothing that was carried or worn by the corpse throughout the ritual. At the same moment the shadow creature is completed, the targeted corpse and all of its attendant equipment vanishes, melting away like snow. The false creature brought into existence by the ring of the shadow victim has the same base ability scores, type, and subtype as the targeted corpse. It appears in all ways to be the same individual as the corpse touched, and it retains the general personality, attitude, abilities, and intellect of that creature. However, this duplicate doesn't possess any memories that the wearer of the ring doesn't also possess, has no spell-like or supernatural abilities, can't use activated extraordinary abilities, can't gain the benefits of healing, can't gain levels or increase its abilities, and can't have more than 3 Hit Dice. This false creature behaves much like the target did in life, except it has a starting attitude of helpful toward the ring's wearer and is generally willing to assist the wearer in any endeavor. The shadow creature will take nearly any action to aid the wearer of the ring, including dangerous, foolish or suicidal actions.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows. Element Saving Throw Penalty   Air –2 against earth-based effects   Earth –2 against air- or electricity-based effects   Fire –2 against water- or cold-based effects   Water –2 against fire-based effects In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.
