As a standard action, the wearer can touch his animal companion to attach an invisible, incorporeal cord to it that, if it can be seen by anyone, appears to be superficially tied to the silver soul cord. This forms a deeper bond between the wearer and the animal companion. It can be attached to only one animal companion at a time. If the animal companion is killed or the link is broken while the cord is attached in this manner (though very few things can destroy the incorporeal cord), the wearer and the animal companion each gain a negative level and the silver soul cord cannot be reattached to any creature for 24 hours. The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove the cord as a standard action. While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond. The creature regains 1 hit point for every 1 hit point the wearer sacrifices. The wearer can sacrifice a maximum number of hit points per turn equal to his hit dice, and can't sacrifice hit points if doing so would reduce him to 0 hit points or fewer. ",

  "description": " a summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color as the endless sky of the astral plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends. As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in elemental body iii ; if it's a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in plant shape ii ; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in undead anatomy iii um .

Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer of a robe of magma can conjure a great burst of magma from deep below the surface. This ability can be used only while the wearer is on the material plane, and only while on solid ground on a planetary body. The deeper beneath a planet's surface the wearer is, the sooner the magma arrives. If the wearer uses this ability while 8,000 feet (or more) below the surface, the magma arrives instantaneously. If she uses it between 2,000 and 8,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives at the beginning of the wearer's next turn. If she uses it on the surface or down to 2,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives in 1d4 rounds. Once the magma arrives, it bursts from the ground in a geyser that sprays up to 40 feet in height and showers a 20-foot radius centered on the location of the wearer when this ability was activated. This deals 20d6 points of fire damage to creatures in the area (reflex dc 22 half) and creates a shallow pool of lava in the area of the burst. The magma geyser continues for 1d3 rounds. For each round that the geyser continues, the pool of lava expands its radius by 10 feet. Creatures that enter the pool of lava or begin their turn in this area take 2d6 points of fire damage. Once the magma geyser stops, this pool cools and hardens over the course of 1d3 rounds. The magma arrives through an extradimensional space and does not impact any features or terrain located under its point of conjuration. ",

The boots constantly murmur telepathically to the wearer, alternating between sycophantic praise of the wearer's prowess and smug assurance that the boots will ensure that the wearer comes to no harm while underwater. The unctuous waders urge the wearer to explore beneath the waves, hoping to find some clues as to their creators and purpose, which the boots have long ago forgotten. If the wearer goes for more than a week without submerging herself in the ocean, the unctuous waders become less obsequious and more demanding. The unctuous waders can remove the ability to allow the wielder to breathe underwater, which they might do as a threat to compel obedience, or out of mere petulance. Three times per day as a standard action, the unctuous waders can exude slimy water from the heels to propel the user, as the slipstream spell. ",

On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early. Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate.

  "description": " these rough leather gloves grant an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with improvised weapons. Alternatively, the gloves can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to melee or thrown weapons (see pages 136 137 of pathfinder rpg ultimate equipment for a list of abilities). Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Gloves of improvised might cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Unlike an amulet of mighty fists , gloves of improvised might must have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability. Normal weapons are unaffected by gloves of improvised might except when used as an improvised weapon in a way specifically permitted by the weapon such as using an arrow or bolt as a melee weapon (or if the user has an ability that allows the use of normal weapons as improvised weapons). The wearer still takes a 4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls with improvised weapons, as normal, unless he has the catch off-guard feat or a similar ability. ",

  "description": " this normal-looking helm takes its\r true form and manifests its powers\r when the user dons it and speaks the\r command word. Made of brilliant silver\r and polished steel, a newly created\r helm is set with large magic gems: 10\r diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and\r 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and\r sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, \r gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: diamond: prismatic spray (save dc 20)\r ruby: wall of fire fire opal: fireball (10d6, reflex dc 20 half)\r opal: daylight the helm may be used once per round, but each gem can\r perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are\r depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical\r properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. \r this light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such\r creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become\r a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the\r weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does\r not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its\r powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a\r jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical\r fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails\r an additional dc 15 will save, the remaining gems on the\r helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within\r range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from\r the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on\r the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed. ",

  "description": " this necklace is a string of intricately carved bones that hold fragments of drowned souls. The wearer can mimic the voice of anyone whose spirit is stored in the necklace as if using sound mimicry . Additionally, the wearer can destroy a bone as a standard action to summon a drowned shade, which has the stats of a water elemental with the following changes. A drowned shade gains undead immunities and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which imposes a 5 penalty on swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning. Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to heal herself (this is not an action). A minor soul bone summons a small water elemental drowned shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons a medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard soul bone summons a large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points; and a greater soul bone summons a huge water elemental drowned shade or heals 7d8+11 hit points. The necklace's listed price does not include the price of bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning a sentient creature and paying the additional cost. The requirements are as follows minor (300, 2-hd sacrifice), lesser (1,400, 4-hd sacrifice), standard (2,250, 8-hd sacrifice), and greater (3,300, 10-hd sacrifice). ",

Thus, karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by nualia in chapter one, as she is unknown to him, but once the pcs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a sihedron medallion in xin-shalast. While worn, a sihedron medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

When two people with a strong emotional bond (such as good friends, family members, or lovers) each wear one of the lockets containing a keepsake from the other person (usually a lock of hair or small picture), the lockets' magic becomes evident. After 24 hours of wearing a linked locket, each wearer knows the condition of the other, as a constant status spell. In addition, when either wearer uses the aid another action to assist the wearer of the linked locket, the bonus gained is increased by 1. Lastly, once per day, each wearer may use one of the known skills of the wearer of the linked locket, as borrow skill (pathfinder rpg advanced player's guide 207). If either wearer of a linked true love locket takes the pendant off, has it forcefully removed, is killed, or travels to another plane, both lockets cease to function until re-attuned after 24 hours.

  "description": " each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : this amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to ac. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, bestow curse , entropic shield bones : this amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to ac for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (will dc 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, entropic shield , scare flame : this amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, burning hands heavens : this black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her wisdom modifier to her charisma modifier on all charisma checks and charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (will dc 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, darkness , locate creature life : this amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A dc 13 will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; cl 10th; craft wondrous item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds stone : this rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself dr 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a 4 penalty to ac. Moderate abjuration; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, heat metal , stoneskin waves : this amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, blur , chill touch wind : this feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

  "description": " each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : this amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to ac. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, bestow curse , entropic shield bones : this amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to ac for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (will dc 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, entropic shield , scare flame : this amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, burning hands heavens : this black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her wisdom modifier to her charisma modifier on all charisma checks and charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (will dc 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, darkness , locate creature life : this amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A dc 13 will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; cl 10th; craft wondrous item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds stone : this rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself dr 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a 4 penalty to ac. Moderate abjuration; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, heat metal , stoneskin waves : this amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, blur , chill touch wind : this feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to ac. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage).

In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect.

  "description": " each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : this amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to ac. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, bestow curse , entropic shield bones : this amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to ac for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (will dc 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, entropic shield , scare flame : this amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, burning hands heavens : this black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her wisdom modifier to her charisma modifier on all charisma checks and charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (will dc 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, darkness , locate creature life : this amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A dc 13 will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; cl 10th; craft wondrous item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds stone : this rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself dr 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a 4 penalty to ac. Moderate abjuration; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, heat metal , stoneskin waves : this amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, blur , chill touch wind : this feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

  "description": " this fist-sized silver badge bears a stylized image of a heraldic animal. The first time a character wears the crest, the animal changes to match that of the wearer's heraldic symbol. If the wearer doesn't have a heraldic animal, it takes the form of an animal appropriate to the character's personality. The animal depicted must be one suitable for use as a druid animal companion (see page 53 of the pathfinder rpg core rulebook). Once a character has worn the crest, the animal depicted on the crest is always the same for that character and can't be changed. Once per day, if the wearer of the crest of the fallen falls unconscious (other than voluntary sleep), the animal on the crest jumps out of the badge and becomes a living creature in an unoccupied square adjacent to the wearer. The creature has the same statistics as a 1st-level druid's animal companion of the same type as depicted on the crest, except its hit points are equal to one-quarter of the wearer's maximum hit points. The creature also gains the 4th- or 7th-level advancement as described in the animal companion's statistics if the wearer is of sufficient level (treating his character level as the effective druid level). It doesn't, however, gain any of the other bonuses or abilities of an animal companion. The creature guards the fallen wearer to the best of its ability. It protects the wearer by attacking enemies, assisting allies using the aid another action, dragging the character's body to a safe location, or taking other helpful actions. The creature can't move more than 50 feet from the badge, and it disappears after 5 rounds. It can't use equipment or magic items, including potions. If the animal is slain, it disappears and the heraldic image on the crest of the fallen fades to a dark gray for 1 week, during which time the crest can't be activated. ",

  "description": " each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : this amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to ac. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, bestow curse , entropic shield bones : this amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to ac for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (will dc 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, entropic shield , scare flame : this amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, burning hands heavens : this black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her wisdom modifier to her charisma modifier on all charisma checks and charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (will dc 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, darkness , locate creature life : this amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A dc 13 will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; cl 10th; craft wondrous item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds stone : this rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself dr 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a 4 penalty to ac. Moderate abjuration; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, heat metal , stoneskin waves : this amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; cl 8th; craft wondrous item, blur , chill touch wind : this feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a 5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful dc 40 disable device check, or broken open with a successful dc 30 strength checkeither method immediately destroys the slave collar . The wearer of a slave collar takes a 10 penalty on disable device or strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears. ",

The hellmouth maw that connects to dis always connects to the souk sinister, an auction house in the city of dis operated by hasharizi, a heavily tattooed contract devil (pathfinder rpg bestiary 3 76). Hasharizi happily offers her services as a fence for stolen goods, and she is willing to search the markets of dis for rare treasures for a commission (typically 10% of the item's cost), providing the talisman's wearer a portable means of liquidating wealth and securing otherwise unavailable goods. It usually takes at least a day for the devil to fence or find the requested items. For those requiring more immediate boons, hasharizi is always willing to tailor an infernal contract to meet her patron's needs. Jyangzipao's other maw opens just outside seventh spire, a lead-brick fortress surrounded by a moat of rusty quicksand in avernus. The ambitious cornugon ulkruoth commands the keep and its ever-growing garrison of warmonger devils (princes of darkness 60) and bearded devils. For a fair price much as though the wearer had cast planar ally he sells his troops' services as mercenaries. For particularly glorious assignments likely to hasten his eventual transformation into a malebranche, ulkruoth is known to halve his price or waive it entirely. ",

  "description": " this turbid blue, teardrop-shaped devil talisman binds a particular devil to a specific location, trapping the fiend in a manner similar to planar binding but without the need for a magic circle and with no chance of the devil escaping. Once bound, the devil cannot move farther than 100 feet from the location it is bound to, and the devil is considered helpful toward the talisman's wearer for the purposes of any request related to the location it is bound to (thus negating the need for an opposed charisma check to convince the bound devil to perform such a service). A creature must be wearing the phlegmatic talisman to make requests of the bound devil. When within 100 feet of each other, the wearer of the phlegmatic talisman and the devil bound to it cannot attack or take offensive actions against one another, even if magically influenced (such as by charm monster or dominate monster). In addition, when within 100 feet of each other, the wearer and the bound devil each gain a +4 profane bonus on will saves against spells and effects that possess or exercise mental control over a creature (including effects with the charm or compulsion descriptors). A phlegmatic talisman is crafted to bind a specific devil, and is not capable of binding any other creature. Any mortal who meets the construction requirements can craft a phlegmatic talisman as long as she knows the true name of the devil to be bound to the talisman, which must be spoken during the item's creation. In order to finally bind the devil to the talisman, the wearer of the talisman must touch the talisman to the devil in the location the devil will be bound to (so the wearer and the devil must both be physically present in the binding location) and speak the devil's true name. If the devil bound to a phlegmatic talisman is destroyed on the same plane as the talisman, the talisman breaks and loses its magic. Conversely, if the phlegmatic talisman binding the devil is destroyed, the devil is freed.

Each time a creature of the wearer's size or smaller attempts to grapple the wearer, it must succeed at a dc 15 reflex save or fail at the attempt and be engulfed by quicksand (pathfinder rpg core rulebook 427). Every round it's trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a swim check (dc 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others. A creature that fails its swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown. A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to grapple the wearer again. A quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature were grappled. A quicksand cloak of any size can contain only one creature at a time; a creature attempting to grapple the wearer while the cloak already contains a body is not affected by the cloak. ",

If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon. Speak with animals 1/day. If the wearer can already use speak with animals as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will. The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using beast shape i . In addition, if the wearer is a skinwalker, her change shape ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the skinwalker heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear pelt of the beast could use her change shape ability to gain a climb speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to darkvision from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features.

While in this form, the wearer also gains a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, as well as a +4 bonus on fly skill checks due to this maneuverability. ",

  "description": " colored a muted gray, this cloak would be nondescript were it not for a single clasp of silver, stylized as a trio of skulls and inlaid with three large blue pearls. By pressing the first pearl as a move action, the wearer causes the illumination level in a 30-foot radius to decrease by one step toward dim light, from bright light to normal light or from normal light to dim light. While active, the cloak also deadens the sounds the wearer makes (as sculpt sound). This prevents the wearer from communicating verbally, casting spells with verbal components, speaking command words, and so on. Pressing this pearl again suppresses this effect. This effect lasts for 15 minutes and can be used at will. The second pearl also requires a move action to activate, and can be activated only while the first pearl is active. Activating the second pearl transports the wearer to the edge of the material plane where it borders the shadow plane. This functions as shadow walk , but only the wearer of the cloak is affected. This ability can be used once per week. While recharging, the second pearl changes color to a gleaming white. Once recharged, it returns to its former dark blue coloration. The final pearl must be removed from the clasp and dropped as a move action. This breaks the jewel, causing wisps of shadowy vapor to engulf the wearer, granting him the benefits of shadow body oa for the following 15 minutes. Once destroyed, the third pearl can't be used again. ",

The armbands grow heavier and hinder the wearer's momentum under these circumstances, causing him to take a 4 penalty on attack rolls against creatures he would otherwise consider allies. Alternatively, two creatures can each wear one of the armbands, occupying the wrists slot for both. Under these conditions, the bands apply only half the normal penalty on attack rolls against allies. However, the two wearers ignore each other for any effects that would cause them to attack the closest creature, unless one wearer purposefully attacks the other. Even if the wearers do attack one another, their attacks take the full 4 penalty, always fail to confirm critical hits, and deal nonlethal damage only. ",

  "description": " these iron bracers are covered in hooks and small claws. They strap firmly to the wearer's forearms and can be used to make attacks as spiked gauntlets. Three times per day, the bracers' wearer can telekinetically anchor herself to a foe within 190 feet as a full-round action. This requires a combat maneuver check, which doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every size category by which her target is larger than she. On a successful check, either the wearer or the target (whichever weighs less) moves to be adjacent to the other (moving to the closest free adjacent space). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. For 1 minute, the wearer and target are kept adjacent by the power of the bracers. Each is able to move only by succeeding at an opposed strength check, and always takes the other along even if successful. Additionally, both the wearer and the target are unable to engage in dimensional travel for this duration, as if under the effect of a dimensional anchor spell. The wearer of the anchoring bracers can dismiss the anchoring effect before the end of its duration as a standard action. ",

  "description": " this rune-carved bracelet is made of thick, bright gold and allows the wearer to manipulate time through electricity magic. As a swift action, the wearer can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the benefits of haste for 1 round. The staggered and haste effects affect only one target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage) is not subject to the additional effect. (a target of an additional effect that successfully saves against the electricity spell but still takes partial damage is still subject to the additional effect.) if the wearer takes at least 50 points of electricity damage from a single source (such as a trap or a spell), the wearer immediately benefits from the effects of time stop, and the electro-temporal bracer ceases functioning for 1 month.
