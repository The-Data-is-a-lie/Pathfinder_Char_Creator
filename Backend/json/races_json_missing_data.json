Their appearance is mostly determined by the species of vine used in their creation, but most have a large cluster of leaves that forms a face with round eyes, a small mouth, and no visible nose.",
      "Society": ": Because of their ritual-based genesis, vine leshys do not have a traditional family structure. They form strong friendships with those who accompany them on explorations or who assist them in protecting a natural site. Unlike most leshys, vine leshys usually feel a strong desire to seek out the one who created them. They see their creators as friends and allies rather than as parents.",
      "Relations": ": Vine leshys are interested in learning about the cultures of many other races. Their initial attitudes when they encounter new races are based on biases from the nature spirit's past incarnations, but they evolve over time through the leshy's experiences. In unfamiliar situations, vine leshys prefer to blend in with vegetation to observe before venturing out and introducing themselves.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Vine leshys see themselves as part of the ancient cycle of nature. They care for their friends and any natural areas under their care, but rarely feel compelled toward either charity or malice. Most vine leshys are truly neutral, and they almost always have at least one neutral aspect to their alignments. Religion is not particularly important to vine leshys. Those who do find faith tend toward worship of Gozreh, a green man , or one of the Eldest of the First World (see page 130), but the Green Faith is the most common philosophy followed by vine leshys.",
      "Adventurers": ": Like most leshys, vine leshys typically do not fear death. They know that if their bodies die, their spirits will return to the natural world and may someday find themselves in new bodies. This lack of fear combined with their curiosity leads them to take risks. However, they typically avoid excessively dangerous activities, as they would rather gather a story from their adventures to tell later. Vine leshys gravitate toward classes that let them use their connection to nature, such as druid and ranger.",
      "Names": ": Vine leshys' names change throughout their lives. A young vine leshy typically names herself after her physical characteristics or a natural feature that she particularly enjoys. As vine leshys age, they modify their names to better reflect their personality and experiences. A leshy may even have several names that she cycles among, such as one name for each season. Most vine leshys select names that are at least two words long. Example vine leshy names include Burbling Waterfall, Lovely Triple Leaves, Masterful Sun Drinker, Snowy Pine Branches, Verdant Taleweaver, and Vibrant Tree Climber.Vine leshys grow best in areas where they can receive ample sunlight.

An undine's straight, thick hair tends to be of a similar, yet slightly darker color than her skin. All have limpid blue eyes.

Aside from their coloration, their most racially defining traits remain their fin-like ears and webbed hands and feet.",
      "Society": ": Undines define themselves as a unique race and are capable of producing undine offspring. While they remain able to interbreed with humans, they tend to keep to themselves, and form small, reclusive communities near bodies of water, or in some cases, floating settlements. A typical undine community lives under the guidance of a small council comprising officials appointed by consensus. Council positions can be held indefinitely, though a community unhappy with the performance of a council member can call for her resignation.",
      "Relations": ": Undines hold no biases or prejudices toward any particular races. Their communities rely primarily on trade, giving them ample opportunity to interact with a diverse range of outsiders and foreigners. They have no qualms about establishing neighborhoods within the settlements of other races, provided adequate respect is given to both the undines and any nearby bodies of water. Still, in such instances, a given undine community does what it can to retain its autonomy.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Most undines are neutral. Their principle interests lie in the welfare of their people, and thus their moral concerns focus upon the community and upon themselves. This neutral view also allows them to interact with a broad scope of non-undine races with whom they trade. While not deeply religious, undines possess a strong spiritual connection to both their supernatural ancestors and to water itself. Those who pursue nonsecular paths almost always worship the gods of their ancestors or gods whose portfolios feature some aspect of water.",
      "Adventurers": ": On occasion, an undine leaves her people to seek out a life of adventure. Like water itself, some undines simply feel compelled to move, and adventuring gives them an ample excuse for living on the road. Others adventure for less wholesome reasons, and exile is a common punishment for crimes within undine society.

Centuries ago, a sahuagin nation from the Inner Sea mobilized a city-sized saltwater bolus for an overland assault on a merfolk state located near modern-day Korvosa. The merfolk learned of this ambitious plan and sent an elite group of soldiers in saltwater tanks to intercept the ocean-bubble. The two sides clashed in Lake Encarthan and eventually worked their way up into what is now the River Kingdoms. In this battle, many of the wizards maintaining the sahuagin’s briny mobile fortress perished, and the two sides ended up stranded hundreds of miles from any ocean. Begrudgingly putting aside their grievances, the merfolk and sahuagin worked together to prevent their mutual extinction, holding back the fresh water with spells and building the settlement of Outsea to serve as a permanent home.

In addition, most have a great deal of body hair and are generally unkempt. Most have a tan skin complexion due to an excessive amount of time spent outdoors, gathering food and hunting prey.",
      "Society": ": Primitive humans live in small clans ruled over either by the clan's elders or its most brutal and warlike members. Such clans usually span only a few generations with members frequently mixing with those from other nearby clans. Occasionally a number of clans will band together or gather for a large moot, but such unifications are short-lived unless held together by a particularly powerful or charismatic leader.",
      "Relations": ": Primitive humans are fearful of most other races, and this fear often drives them to violence when they come in contact with such outsiders. To them, there is little difference between an elf and a goblin; both are a threat to the clan. They view Half-Orcs and half-elves with distrust, but some have been known to accept such exotic kin into their fold, occasionally even viewing them as superior, thus placing them in a position of importance.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Primitive humans rarely follow any set of laws other than those of the tribe, and even these are often quite flexible. Likewise, codified concepts of good and evil are somewhat extreme for these simple folk, who often spend most of their time just trying to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. There are exceptions of course—some primitive humans strive to help their fellows, and others embrace total barbarism and wanton destruction. Most primitive humans have only a simple understanding of religion, worshiping the forces of nature and spirits of the world around them. They are known to make offerings and sacrifices to placate their deities and garner their favor.",

      "Society": ": Gathlain society is built around art, discovery, experimentation, and storytelling. These fey constantly seek new ways to look at the world. Gathlain leaders are often popular explorers followed primarily as idols worth emulating and as sources of intriguing gossip. Although gathlains tend to engage in raucous romances born of melodramatic or fanciful encounters, they do not procreate conventionally from such pairings, even when the two happen to be of different physical sexes. Gathlains show little interest in gender, finding it quaint when other races use it as a basis for assigning roles or choosing partners.",
      "Relations": ": Gathlains associate with a variety of other fey as freely as among their own kind. These mixed communities of fey are called courts and feature elaborate titles for those members deemed most interesting or most worthy of admiration. When a gathlain chooses to join a different community, it is generally a temporary membership, whether it lasts only a season or persists for decades. Adventuring gathlains frequently seek out and attempt to mingle with like-minded gnomes; however, gnomes often find gathlains too flighty, foolish, and undisciplined for their tastes.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Mischievous and capricious, gathlains have discordant temperaments. Most are chaotic, and they tend to be morally neutral. The typical gathlain finds mortal religions strange; like many fey, they trade respect and token offerings to godlike fey in exchange for protection, but they see little difference between that and offerings to lesser kings and queens.",
      "Adventurers": ": Gathlains strive to entertain themselves and sate their immense curiosity about the world around them, and those who decide to become adventurers often migrate to the Material Plane to explore. Those who remain in the First World seek the strangest parts of their home plane and try to learn about its most unusual inhabitants. They favor spellcasting classes and skilled classes such as bard or rogue.",

// Ghoran

  {
    "Ghoran": {
      "Source": "Ultimate Wilderness pg. 16",
      "Monster Entry": "Link",
      "Physical Description": ": The typical ghoran stands roughly as tall as a human and occupies a similar silhouette, but that's where their similarities with humanity end. A ghoran's \"skin\" is a complex layer of fibrous vines and rinds with a texture similar to moss-covered bark. Ghoran faces consist of layered petals that flush and flutter at a whim, allowing them to mimic the facial behaviors of their wouldbe devourers. They do not lack emotion per se, but ghoran \"feelings\" are primordial and abstract, making them utterly alien to most non-ghorans. A ghoran might laugh, smile, or raise its voice, but their companions seldom understand if these are displays of true emotion or merely more adaptive evolutions designed—like so many other aspects of their physiology—simply to keep them alive.",
      "Society": ": A ghoran's alien thought processes (to say nothing of the empty holes upon its flower-petal face roughly approximating its eyes and mouth) make it very difficult for other races to understand and empathize with, leading many ghorans to stick to themselves in segregated communities of cosmopolitan and magic-rich city-states or in the deepest wild places of their barren homeland and its neighboring kingdoms.",
      "Relations": ": Ghorans are most comfortable with other intelligent plants (such as treants and vine leshys) and wary around plant-eating creatures (including humans, whom ghorans know created them as a food source). Because their regeneration brings minor personality changes with each incarnation, ghorans have trouble forming long-lasting relationships with races such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes. Ghorans deeply distrust warmongering humanoids such as goblins and gnolls, especially those with pyromaniac tendencies. The ghorans' relation with humanity is the most complex, for while they admire humans for their capacities and are grateful for their creation, they fear their appetites more, and it is difficult for a ghoran to trust that a human doesn't simply want to eat it.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Ghorans seldom follow humanoid deities, instead preferring to worship nature itself by means of the Green Faith (see page 136) or other powerful nature spirits, such as the Eldest of the First World. Ghorans have no predisposition toward law, chaos, good, or evil, but many struggle to differentiate right from wrong as defined by most societies.",
      "Adventurers": ": Owing to their delicious nature, ghorans seldom know peace the way that humanoid races do, and many are forced to contend with nature and learn to fight as a means of self-defense against capture and consumption. Many have taken to adventuring lifestyles either to aid friends and companions or out of a darker drive for vengeance. Others join adventuring groups in hopes of accumulating enough power and lore to, perhaps, determine a solution to their race's central problem of reproduction, though so far no ghoran has solved this essential riddle.",
      "Names": ": Ghoran naming conventions seem random, as each ghoran is self-named and \"born\" with a near perfect recollection of every memory from previous incarnations. As a result, ghorans sometimes pick names they found pleasing in other lives or name themselves after people or places they once knew. Others maintain the same name over several incarnations, though minor personality and physical changes from life to life ensure that while the ghoran's name might remain the same, aspects of the ghoran's gradual change can often confuse and frustrate longtime friends and allies.: Ghorans are hardy, guileful, and eager to explore their emotions, but they process complex thoughts slowly.",

The caster level is equal to the ghoran's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the ghoran's Charisma bonus.",
      "Seed (Ex)": ": As a full-round action, a ghoran can expel the seed from an orifice in its abdomen. If planted in fertile ground and left undisturbed for 2d6 days, the seed grows into a healthy duplicate of the original ghoran, save that the duplicate can reallocate all skill ranks upon sprouting. Once a ghoran expels this seed, it gains 1 negative level, and it dies as soon as the duplicate sprouts. This duplicate replaces the previous ghoran character.",

In addition to gaining a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, when such ganzis are affected by a hostile transmutation effect (such as polymorphing or petrification), they can attempt a new saving throw at the start of their next turn to end the effect. They gain a +4 bonus on this second saving throw, but if they fail, the transmutation effect persists as long as it normally would.",

          "Due to the Maelstrom’s entropic influence on their compositions, ganzis each have an unusual but defining feature—referred to as an oddity—that sets them apart from other races and even from other members of their own race. These oddities vary wildly from ganzi to ganzi, and they can manifest as physical features, such as feathers, scales, or a tail, or as more subtle magical abilities. At the GM’s discretion, players with ganzi characters can roll 1d20 to randomly determine what form their characters’ oddities take using the list below.: The influence of the Maelstrom manifests in the ganzi’s ability to transform one of her limbs at will, often into a natural weapon such as a massive clawed arm. Every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, a ganzi can transform one of her limbs into a natural melee weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. The transformation lasts until the beginning of the ganzi’s next turn. The damage dealt by this natural weapon can be lethal or nonlethal, at the ganzi’s discretion, and she chooses whether the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.: As a standard action, the ganzi can spit a stream of opaque, black ink from her mouth to a distance of up to 20 feet. The ganzi can target either a creature or a square on the ground, each with different effects, as detailed below. The ganzi can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 Hit Dice she has.: The ganzi shoots a stream of ink into a creature’s eyes as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. If the ganzi hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi’s Hit Dice + the ganzi’s Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.: The ganzi spits the ink into a single square on the ground within 30 feet, which becomes slippery for 1d6 rounds. Any creatures entering the square must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi’s Hit Dice + the ganzi’s Constitution modifier) or fall prone.: A ganzi whose lineage is linked to hunduns might inherit an aspect of the outsiders’ chaotic minds.
